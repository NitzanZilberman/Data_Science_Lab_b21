With Storm: Storm is a data streaming engine. Flink supports batch data analysis, and (as of recently) data streaming analysis. The APIs of the two systems are also different. Storm's API revolves around spouts, bolts, and topologies, whereas the streaming API of Flink revolves around data streams, and windows on streams. 
With Spark: The APIs of Spark and Flink are similar to a first degree of approximation, both based on concepts from functional transformations on collections that are parallelized by the systems. A difference is how the backends of these systems execute these APIs. For an intro to how Flink's backend does that, I recently gave a presentation on the internals of Flink that is available here: http://flink.apache.org/material.html

"69",37673,"Great write-up. Thanks...  
&gt; I think the situation is not as bad as we all are making it to be.  
You are right, it isn't. But...  
First of all we were spoiled a bit. We were ready to start celebrations before Ba≈üak≈üehir game. We got kicked in the nuts. Not just by the score but by the way they out played us. So that was a bummer. But we still had a chance to overcome that unpleasant feeling by winning against FB. And we got kicked again. This time it was worse though. We did it to ourselves.   
Now at this point it isn't about our strength or quality of our players/game. It's completely pyhcological. I know there are FB/GS fans that want us to win instead of Ba≈üak≈üehir. But other than that most of the actors in this game (rival clubs, government, TFF, media) will be against us. We know that. Or lets just say we feel that. We also know we are not that good enough under pressure. Yes we won last year but we had a great, experienced duo (Gomez, Sosa). We have Talisca and Aboubakar instead of them. And simply put, we now know that they are not that good enough under pressure :(    
Talisca will likely to get, at least 2 match ban. Maybe it won't be a problem against Bursa and Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. Maybe it won't be a problem at all. But this will re-enforce that ""us against everybody else"" feeling. And that feeling will put us under more pressure. So it will hurt us one way or another. I'm not even going to start getting 3rd star...
So our problem is managing and using that pressure. And up to this day we weren't that good at it. That's what worries me. Not the fixtures or the way we play. Good thing is after FB game first thing came to my mind was last years Akhisar game. Lets hope the affect will be the same...",0,"great writeup thanks

first of all we were spoiled a bit we were ready to start celebrations before baÂˇakÂˇehir game we got kicked in the nuts not just by the score but by the way they out played us so that was a bummer but we still had a chance to overcome that unpleasant feeling by winning against fb and we got kicked again this time it was worse though we did it to ourselves   
now at this point it isnt about our strength or quality of our playersgame its completely pyhcological i know there are fbgs fans that want us to win instead of baÂˇakÂˇehir but other than that most of the actors in this game rival clubs government tff media will be against us we know that or lets just say we feel that we also know we are not that good enough under pressure yes we won last year but we had a great experienced duo gomez sosa we have talisca and aboubakar instead of them and simply put we now know that they are not that good enough under pressure     
talisca will likely to get at least 2 match ban maybe it wont be a problem against bursa and kas‰±mpaÂˇa maybe it wont be a problem at all but this will reenforce that us against everybody else feeling and that feeling will put us under more pressure so it will hurt us one way or another im not even going to start getting 3rd star
so our problem is managing and using that pressure and up to this day we werent that good at it thats what worries me not the fixtures or the way we play good thing is after fb game first thing came to my mind was last years akhisar game lets hope the affect will be the same",-0.746481626466542,-0.184008156991464,57.1346372211959,-71.3803271575892,0.139275766016713,0.0167130919220056,0,14,0.0425531914893617,10,0.0303951367781155,0,0

To me, next year is the measuring stick because there will be no more excuses. Mac will have his hand-picked QBs and supporting cast running the offense. If at this point next year we still look like dog shit on offense, then we have a legitimate problem.

It is reasonable in my mind given the current circumstances surrounding our team. When Mac inherited this team, we had 1 capable QB on the team (Grier), and we saw flashes of greatness with him in his limited time here. Then you look at the other 3 QBs we had as options: a glorified WR (Treon), a walk-on backup transfer from Oregon State (Del Rio) and a graduate transfer from Purdue with a career sub-60% completion percentage (Appleby). You could make an argument for throwing the freshmen in there, but at a certain point in the season, I think Mac committed to redshirting them and that is fine.

"165",37914,"When the Bolton men had their aside, Lyonel had unbuckled the black leather belt that held his sword and parrying dagger on it, and wrapped it before they turned around. He'd dropped it to the floor to show the guards he meant no cause to draw either. 
Before they had finished their whispering Lyonel had already begun to undo the first buckle on his long coat. When Domeric gave the order, Lyonel only sighed. ""I was hoping this would go differently. It seems I'll have to bare it all out here."" 
""I finally understand the kind of man you are, Lord Domeric. I can tell you care about your daughter, and your son. But you seem to misunderstand the kind of man I am. You called me persistent. If I was just persistent, my lord, I'd not have spent the last five years sleeping on a mattress on the stone floor of a basement office while I recovered from having my ribs six in six places all while repairing a decrepit building.""
""If I was persistent, I'd not have met with the rank and file of the Gold Cloaks, befriending the ones I found to be trust worthy. Spending time with them, learning about them, their families, their friends, and the people of this city they knew and loved."" 
""If I was persistent....my lord, if I was *just* persistent than I would not have donned a disguise every afternoon, I would not have spent a small fortune over the last five years providing food, clothing, and medicine to the urchins and beggars. The downtrodden and forgotten. All of this this just to unravel the deception of the person who had started this war between our people's.""
By now the long coat had been fully unbuckled and it slid easily enough off of his shoulders, crumpling on the ground. Beneath, Lyonel wore a black and gold vest over a white shirt. However, despite the fine make, and the preservation found in the care of the shirt, it clashed fiercely over the forearms or the shirt. Unlike the cloak, the shirt he'd worn that day, his finest shirt, had not been repaired. 
The shirts sleeves from the elbow lower were colored a dark reddish brown, the color of dried blood, that somehow matched the fresh pink scars that covered his forearms. 
""A persistent man would have given up long before then. Long before, and most certainly after the sealskin plague struck this city. He would not have seen the suffering of the smallfolk he had come to know. He would not have done everything he could to find out about the plague, and then sought to care for them. All the while justifying that he needed to do this to get the information from them, but knowing that from the moment he saw...he saw the children and new born babes suffering from it, he couldn't turn his back on them.""
""A persistent man, who had not slept in three days would not have, when hearing that the house, the very steps of which you stand now, had been struck with the plague. He would not have approached this house in disguise, and he would not have treated your men, some of whom you may be asking to throw me out, would not have treated the young maid, and most importantly, when he saw your daughter..."" Lyonel paused as he looked up to the window that was Roslyn's room. The one Benedict didn't even know he already knew where it was. ""...on death's door, about to join those who had past on. She was so pale, her bed and shift soaked in sweat, my lord. She could hardly breath and her skin felt as though dragon fire was under her skin.""
""A persistent man would not have held her close, nursing her back from that cliff's edge. He would not have whispered his pleas to her, begging her to stay. He would not have stayed at her side, holding her and coaxing her to health until the fever broke. A persistent man, after all this, would not have returned back to the smallfolk.""
The son of Stryfe returned his gaze to the Highlord of the Dreadfort as he rolled up his sleeves to show the full extent of his scars. 
""A persistent man would not have...he would not have used his alias and his connections to find the men who attacked Lady Whent and started this recent blow up between our kingdoms. And he would not have ordered himself to be attacked in order to draw them out into the open.""
""He would not have been able to use those he knew could be trusted among the Gold Cloaks to assist him, and when eight men attacked him, a persistent man would not have endured the assault enough to have them men all apprehended to be interrogated. And he would not have finally found the person responsible for what began this entire debacle to begin with.""
""A persistent man would not be standing now before you, sharing this with you, telling you he has risked his life, his liberty, and his sacred honor. All to be before you today. He would not offer himself to be your hostage, and he would not be willing to marry a woman who not only has chosen another man before, but who he still loves despite everything.""
""I told you I knew what kind of a man you were, or rather the kind of father you are. You are a father willing to save your daughter's good name, and that of your family's, to ensure no one ever knows what the result of her dalliance with the Ki- with Bael."" Lyonel corrected himself. ""So much so you will marry her to a man whom for the rest of your days you can exert control and pressure to ensure that you control the narrative of the event. Likely one of the reasons I found Benedict in the bar some time ago is because it's far more acceptable for it to be the result of what he'd caused.""
""My lord, I have accepted pain, I have accepted suffering, and I have accepted defeat. I accept Roslyn, not as I knew her or met her. But as she is, who she is. And that includes what she has done and the result of it."" Lyonel told Domeric, his blue-green eyes may have well been grey, as the intensity of his trial bore forth like a freshly steel blade.

"307",14405,"That does not go against smart game development.  The current echo chamber about what smart game development is goes against smart game development.  There are systems that need optimization that would not be completely broken and risk being too entrenched as features are added to be optimized later.
For instance, structures are a huge source of lag in this game that will need to be addressed to improve performance.  Finding a way to make structures exist that requires fewer resources sooner improves gameplay for everyone.  Not doing so leaves the risk that, as more structures and objects in the gameworld are added, structures begin to make calls to functions that are poorly managing memory.  Optimizing structure memory use at a later date then risks breaking many structures, requiring each broken structure to be investigated as to why it does not work under the new structure code.  The alternative, of figuring out and fixing the reason that structures cause so much lag now, then adding new structures later with the fixed model, saves time overall as there is no need to redo things after drastic changes in the code.
New content doesn't really risk breaking optimization outside of its area of the code.  A new creature or item, for instance, won't affect chunk loading unless the coder is completely incompetent, which isn't the case here.  If it does something radically new, it might point out a flaw in some of the code it calls, but that's something that probably should have been taken care of when first implemented.  The efficient resource use in the code needs to be part of the code from as early a point as possible.
If anything, optimizing later risks breaking more things in the game than doing it earlier.  It also has a tendency to just never happen.  The real reason they put it off is because new features are fun, for fans, the media, and developers.  Fans feel like nothing is being done if the devs spend a month on optimization, the media doesn't put out any articles advertising the game if nothing new is added, and it's just plain boring for most devs to go back and look at what they did when they have some cool, new idea buzzing in their head.
Optimizing during development is the smartest way to do things because you can maintain good/acceptable performance while never letting the backlog of systems that need to be optimized get too long.  The key thing people have to admit is that development never stops.  After release there will either be continued content patches, DLC, or work on a sequel/successor.  Then optimization gets put off longer or delegated to a skeleton crew that can at best slowly improve the issues baked into the code, risking breaking huge parts of the final code as they try to chase down a memory leak or some poor management of pointers or so on.  Enough time goes by and they become more useful working on the next game, and the cycle continues...",0,"that does not go against smart game development  the current echo chamber about what smart game development is goes against smart game development  there are systems that need optimization that would not be completely broken and risk being too entrenched as features are added to be optimized later
for instance structures are a huge source of lag in this game that will need to be addressed to improve performance  finding a way to make structures exist that requires fewer resources sooner improves gameplay for everyone  not doing so leaves the risk that as more structures and objects in the gameworld are added structures begin to make calls to functions that are poorly managing memory  optimizing structure memory use at a later date then risks breaking many structures requiring each broken structure to be investigated as to why it does not work under the new structure code  the alternative of figuring out and fixing the reason that structures cause so much lag now then adding new structures later with the fixed model saves time overall as there is no need to redo things after drastic changes in the code
new content doesnt really risk breaking optimization outside of its area of the code  a new creature or item for instance wont affect chunk loading unless the coder is completely incompetent which isnt the case here  if it does something radically new it might point out a flaw in some of the code it calls but thats something that probably should have been taken care of when first implemented  the efficient resource use in the code needs to be part of the code from as early a point as possible
if anything optimizing later risks breaking more things in the game than doing it earlier  it also has a tendency to just never happen  the real reason they put it off is because new features are fun for fans the media and developers  fans feel like nothing is being done if the devs spend a month on optimization the media doesnt put out any articles advertising the game if nothing new is added and its just plain boring for most devs to go back and look at what they did when they have some cool new idea buzzing in their head
optimizing during development is the smartest way to do things because you can maintain goodacceptable performance while never letting the backlog of systems that need to be optimized get too long  the key thing people have to admit is that development never stops  after release there will either be continued content patches dlc or work on a sequelsuccessor  then optimization gets put off longer or delegated to a skeleton crew that can at best slowly improve the issues baked into the code risking breaking huge parts of the final code as they try to chase down a memory leak or some poor management of pointers or so on  enough time goes by and they become more useful working on the next game and the cycle continues",-0.548743697694853,-0.174962754478935,46.2300339753229,-104.416410786475,0.0411214953271028,0.00373831775700935,0,18,0.0356435643564356,24,0.0475247524752475,0,0

"384",27712,"I have always avoided elections and politics because of two reasons. The first is that they do not appeal to me in the slightest; I have no strong opinions over the major 'issues' that each party sides on. Second, it turns people yucky. Even my own friends become unfamiliar to me as they blurt their opinions left and right as if anyone else cared. It gives me a wretched sour taste. 
However, because I am American and voting is expected of me, I did a crash-course research session yesterday, learning all there is to learn about the candidates, and finally picking my 'side'. Then I voted, which made me feel accomplished. Then I endured the night, and it was terrible ... back and forth, my nerves were frayed.

"593",18143,"I think the intricacy of the malazan series is what hooks me, and part of that is the massive amount of detail that went into the creation of the world. It was originally intended for a role playing game I read somewhere once. So the basis for the world that these characters inhabit has rules that are consistent and secrets to uncover about how it all works and so on and it's just... It hits me in the happy place. 
Richard Adams writes books that similarly hit me in the happy place. They are stand alone novels, and they are incredibly political but they are excellent. Maia is my favourite, though Shardik runs a close second. 
Wheel of Time is epically long and somewhat as... Involved? As Malazan but in my opinion not as well written. There are points in the series where it's obvious to me that the characters ran away with the tale so to speak. 
Sword of Truth is also similarly long, and the thread of the tale wanders a bit, but it is certainly not as well written and gets very preachy with the authors ideals at time, and really sordid with some of his factions who's purpose is seemingly only to vent his BDSM fantasies and not at all necessary for the tale. I mean he could have written said faction in such a way as to make it necessary, but he didn't bother. It's a good 'trashy' ride though. 
A Game Of Thrones is excellent but as of yet unfinished. 
Robin Hobb and her Farseer books are an excellent journey, though not as intricate as the Malazan books. She write several short series revolving around the world the characters inhabit two of which I believe follow the fate of one character, and two of which follow the fate of another major player in his story.

your husband will graduate he will find work  this situation will change  by the time baby is a little older and starting to connect with the world around him you will be able to spend more time with him  you will have a rock solid bond and hes going to love you",-0.759952942402196,-0.184716036361353,30.0542288918092,-25.1692529215631,0.0806451612903226,0.021505376344086,0,6,0.0338983050847458,2,0.0112994350282486,0,0

I am one of the very few parts of the universe which has an active, conscious experience of my existence. And I have that for a limited time. What a wonderful gift! It seems to me, you are defining ""point"" in some vast cosmic sense. Sure, there's little point in that. But why not narrow it? You have an experience, as does everyone else on this planet. I look at the ""point"" of my existence right now as trying to improve the experiences of the people I come into contact with. Paradoxically, when I do that, I feel far better about myself and my own experience. I find meaning and happiness and purpose in my own life, and I'm creating a lasting effect on other people, because they become inspired to help others the same way.
(Martin Seligman gives a TED talk on the subject if you're curious, about ways to find happiness in life--scientific research suggests strongly that the best way is to live a life of meaning).
So sure, you may not have a huge, universal purpose, but why not try to make the lives of those around you better? What's the alternative, doing nothing, or making their experience *worse*? Although you may not be able to impact large scale phenomena, you can certainly have an impact into the people around you, and that to me is a purpose.
(The books ""Morality Without God"" by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and ""The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World"" by Owen Flanagan are two good books on the subject if you want an atheistic perspective. If you're interested in a more spiritual bent, without a traditional God concept, then ""A New Earth"" by Eckhart Tolle is also good reading).",0,"i used to feel exactly the way you describe and i still see the same facts in terms of the universe as a whole yes my actions are largely insignificant but they are not unimportant

A lot of agencies prefer to have freelancers on-site as you're closer to the account and they can monitor your work. However, on smaller jobs I've worked remotely.

"939",27031,"Giving an honest response I don't see how that PBS video would cost 2-3 k for the production step. I doubt anyone doing an educational video would actually hire an actor to memorize a script. They(should) get or already have someone who knows what they are talking about, and then make sure he follows bullet points. But maybe he is a spokesperson reading a prompter of some sort he looks like he might be.

That shoot didn't even require any fancy shooting it's just a camera on a tripod anyone somewhat competent with cameras can do.

So all the person is looking for is either studio rental time for like an hour, very minimal set up is used, so they have access to a solid color background wall/paper, which is normally green, and 1 semi competent person to set up the camera and make sure audio is fine. You normally can't rent out a studio for just an hour usually have minimal half day to full day. So they plan more than 1 shot.

Studios come with the competent person to help initial set up and the camera normally. If someone is charging 2-3 k for that part for something as simple as that then they're over charging by a factor of 10 or more.


Now the editing part is pretty well done. I don't know if those graphics were already in some public repository somewhere(they probably were), or if they were made just for that. The editor for that probably spent maybe 8 hours for those 10 minutes and was decently skilled. This depends on how much pre-planning was in it though. So he can charge $50 to $100 an hour. Assuming very little pre planning and he made the story himself.

A lot of pre-planning went into that though which took up most of the time. It normally should be the person who is hiring these people who do these pre-planning steps. Though someone who doesn't have a clue about what types of pre-planning needs to be done should team up or hire someone who does have a clue, that part could get as expensive as the editor and that is where the director is needed. That advice is usually also given out freely if you purchase studio time. It's pretty much only writing a script, story-boarding, and giving a repository of graphics that you want used.

I do know it's becoming the trend to overcharge on everything because there simply isn't enough work to go around and make a living off of it. But I don't agree with that.. I like giving honest answers. If high skills are necessary then they should charge whatever they want. But to over charge on something something as easy as a stable camera on a tripod and claim it's something highly technical to do. Just begrudges potential and current customers.

Why can I say all of this? I don't have 10+ years of experience but I do have 3+ years of experience at a tv studio and editing room which was rented out daily. My job was jack of all trades and I was always that semi-competent person who were on these 1-3 stable camera interview/green screen type shots, grip, audio etc. I was also the semi-competent editor who sometimes only followed the cut and paste storyboard that someone else already put together for me. If it's all planned out exactly then anyone can do the job. I became competent enough that I took my own jobs and still stuck to the single camera stuff. Even went into the film industry as well and attempted to start my own studio.",0,"giving an honest response i dont see how that pbs video would cost 23 k for the production step i doubt anyone doing an educational video would actually hire an actor to memorize a script theyshould get or already have someone who knows what they are talking about and then make sure he follows bullet points but maybe he is a spokesperson reading a prompter of some sort he looks like he might be

"947",21123,"Well, I literally don't know how to study because I almost always can't form a complex argument. Like, I'm doing relatively fine in calculus 2 now (we are learning ODE's now and it is starting to get harder, at least for me). I did fine on sequences and series, but to be honest I still feel I don't know anything. If I had to prove anything besides than just checking if a series converge (and not any series!) I won't because then I would have to remeber some kind of theorem that I simply don't. I don't know how to explain. Some things I can remember well, but it is just hard to keep track of concepts, definitions and see it all together. Usually you build one concept or definition and then you build another on top of the first one and that's how math works. Then you link it all together and bam, you got something else and that was the whole point of it. Well, that's just hard to keep track, and in the end I end up understanding nothing at all.

Might is the *only* thing that makes right. There is no right and wrong unless you have a way of protecting and enforcing your chosen ethical axioms.
Look at EU for example -- the economic leverage that 27 states have against any single dissenting one is huge, and this forces everyone to play by the rules even in cases where it might hurt their national interest or specific industries. Without a common currency and market, there would be no barrier to states treating EU laws as more of a ""guideline"" and implementing them selectively, whenever they feel like it.
Might is the only thing that can force countries to forgo pursuit of their own interests at the expense of others. Not even the most enlightened European states are going to do this out of the goodness of their hearts and an inherent sense of fairness -- they will only ever do it when the cost of dissent is too great to pay. 
This is why international law, as it stands, is bollocks. There is no law without a court, and there is no court without binding, enforceable decisions, and there's only one way to enforce things. ",0,"gt im not exactly sure how might makes right

Those +1 and +6 numbers are the ""loyalty costs"" of a special type of activated abilities that Planeswalker permanents have called ""loyalty abilities"".

You can only use a loyalty ability during your turn when the stack is empty (basically, not ""in response"" to something else).

She gained weight that she is not comfortable gaining.  Sure, she's still in a healthy weight range but if she was to lose 10 pounds in a healthy way and build muscle, that wouldn't be the end of the world.
You also cannot just diagnose what an appropriate calorie consumption is for her online, which is why I tell her several of times to go get help.  The 1,200 calorie diet was on the top of my brain right now because that's what I need to be eating (something that I've worked out with MY doctors) because I am overweight.  However, that's 1,200 calories of meat and veggies (think close to paleo in terms of what I mostly eat) which is plenty for someone with my size and lifestyle.

"1304",39656,"The fact is, as other people have noted, the attention span isn't what it used to be. With smartphones and computers, we can inhale so much media at such speeds that sitting down to watch a 3+ hour race simply doesn't seem as reasonable to many people. NASCAR won't be able to change that fact, unfortunately. That trend will continue to snowball. 
The flip side of that is that people who don't sit down to watch a whole race may stream it online, or use other forums to keep tabs on what is happening in the sport. 
We're na√Øve if we think a decrease in people sitting for 3.5 hours straight to watch an auto race means our sport is on a death spiral. All of us here are indicative of this fan base, and none of us seem to desire to walk away from this sport. There may be less people watching the full event on Fox every week, but with the sheer volume of viewers, have faith that NASCAR will be able to remain in the public eye and continue to attract sponsors. 
If I'm not mistaken, viewership for other sports has begun to stagnate as well. Maybe we can attribute that fact to the commercialization of the world as we know it and the fact that nothing is ""pure"" anymore. That is true. Everything is about revenues and profitability. NASCAR too. That's why our venues and event formats have almost no turnover from year to year. 
If NASCAR truly cared about expanding its fan base and drumming interest, they would genuinely pursue new venues that could attract new audiences. The conglomerates that control the race venues don't allow for such a dynamic. 
If you truly have a gripe about the current state of our sport, listen to fans literally all over the internet across a plethora of forums: they feel NASCAR doesn't listen to them. NASCAR attempts to draw interest by changing the playoff structure and race format, and publicizing drama such as the Busch-Logano fight, but what fans really want is a different dynamic. Fans want to see something different than a cookie-cutter oval for 40% of the races, where only the horsepower teams have a legitimate chance. I think most of us on this forum are smart enough to recognize that fact. 
NASCAR won't see a reversal of fortunes as long as that remains the case. We continue to be miffed by the indicators that say less people are paying attention, but the answers are pretty clear. 
Consider it from this angle though: are Bruton Smith and the France family going to be harmed if NASCAR falls apart? Certainly not. They already have many lifetimes' fortunes safely tucked away in their bank accounts, and there is still opportunity to increase their childrens' trust funds. Nothing will truly change until profitability goes away entirely or NASCAR is in shambles. Enjoy the ride, I say. This commercialized reality is the best we'll get.

You have to engage them. Attempt to refute/attack their arguments, and gauge their reaction. If they shift goalposts/build strawmen/etc: call them out. If they do it more than once, or attack you rather than your argument: fair enough to disengage.

Ignoring them or demonising them, if they are sincere in their beliefs, will only fester their misguided opinions. This is because they walk away believing they are still right, as their opinions have not been challenged.

China's 'unicorns' nearly double to 131: official
2017-03-27 08:25Xinhua Editor: Gu Liping
China had 131 billion dollars worth of private start-ups by the end of 2016, nearly doubling the figure of the year before, said an official with Ministry of Science and Technology.
Zhang Zhihong, director of the ministry's Torch High Technology Industry Development Center, made the remarks while opening an institute for small and medium enterprise research in Tianjin over the weekend.
He used the term ""unicorn,"" rarely used by Chinese officials, which refers young, unlisted companies with a market value of over 1 billion U.S. dollars, based on private funding sources.
China's unicorns are spread over 16 cities, but mostly in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. The majority are innovation-driven tech businesses, Zhang said.
A report published by the torch center earlier this year said half of China's unicorns are in Beijing's Zhongguancun, home to China's three super-unicorns worth over 10 billion U.S. dollars: Xiaomi, Didi Chuxing, and Meituan.
One third of Zhongguancun's unicorns were born after 2014. They focus on four domains -- e-commerce, culture and entertainment, Internet finance, and transportation, according to the report ""Development of China's Unicorn Enterprises in 2016"".
In fact, Zhongguancun is second only to Silicon Valley as the most concentrated area for tech unicorns in the world, the report says.
Zhang said a pro-innovation business environment, conductive policies, and good services are key to the growth of unicorns.
""Unicorns have become important engine to maintaining medium-high growth and to transforming industry,"" Zhang said. ""Their emergence is key to development of the sharing, smart, and platform economies.""

Here is what I'm not going to let you do! 
I will not let you tell me how I think and feel for real victims. I however think that SP isn't a real victim. 
If at any point she was held against her will and hurt that isn't ok either. No matter if she was on a bender or ran off with someone. 
You're girl has a past history of self harming and attention seeking. When you cry wolf all you're life, people second guess what you are saying! I'm surprised nobody ever told you that story. 
I don't think she was severely beaten. Sorry. I've seen someone severely beaten so I take that very serious. 
As far as her weight goes. I'm surprised that you would think a hospital would let someone go who was malnourished or dehydrated. It doesn't happen! That much I know. SP was very thin before she left! I'm about her height and size and people can also wrap there arms around me a couple times. 
Next! 
Why are you here? Are you just checking out public opinion? Are you trying to gage the way the pubic feels about Sherri?
You seem very passionate and connected to this case. So why in the world do you care what a group of people think if you KNOW it's true??? 
If I were you , I'd be camped out at the sheriffs office asking for results! I would have Sherri go back and do a composite sketch of these alleged perps. 
If you truly truly believe you're girl Sherri, then you are wasting you're time here. Go get a group together to solve this crime! Shit if you gave us true evidence that she was taken, I bet half the people here would jump on board to help! 
You have never once said! Please help us! Please help us push the cops to get this solved! 
You have only wagged you're finger at people who have doubts because there are so many things wrong with this story. 
Here is why most people are like a dog with a bone on this!

√ñsterrike forts√§tter sitt l√•nga arbete att skapa fred i Europa, och bibeh√•lla den √∂mt√•liga Europeiska maktbalansen som √§r s√• viktig f√∂r att f√∂rhindra storskaliga krig, sv√§lt och mis√§r. Men ibland m√•ste man g√• till krig f√∂r att f√∂rhindra mer krig! I  f√∂rsvar till alla kejserliga gr√§nsstater s√• var Kejsaren √∂dmjukt tvungen att bege sig i krig mot Frankrike med resten av kejsard√∂met. 
En episk allians av r√§ttf√§rdiga krigare som slogs f√∂r Europas s√§kerhet, det slutade med att den Franska konungen s√•g vishet i fred och gav upp sina pretentioner p√• den Engelska och Burgundiska kronan. √ñsterrike bad inte om n√•got i detta avtal f√∂rutom fred, och kan heller inte ansvara f√∂r att Provance girigt utpressade Frankrike p√• mer territorium. Ett l√•gt pris f√∂r v√§rldsfrid.
Efter kriget med Frankrike s√• gick det rykten om att kejsaren st√∂dde Republiken Novgorod med guld f√∂r deras f√∂rsvarskrig emot den aggressiva expansionistiska maktalliansen Sverige-Polen-Litauen. Detta f√∂rblir enbart rykten, men om kejsaren hade gjort detta s√• hade det sj√§lvfallet varit r√§ttf√§rdigat, d√• Republiken enbart f√∂rsvarade sitt hemland mot fr√§mmande invasion. Novgorod br√§nde dock sina f√§lt och l√§t fiendearm√©erna sv√§lta, vilket gjorde kriget till kostsamt f√∂r den m√∂rka alliansen.
Gud bestraffar dock dem som ger sig p√• de som √§r mindre √§n dem, och det var inte l√•ngt f√∂ren ett inb√∂rdeskrig br√∂t ut i Byzantinska Riket, som var en n√§ra allierad till den m√∂rka alliansen. Ottomanerna anf√∂ll samtidigt och la bel√§gring p√• Konstantinopel, samtidigt som B√∂hmen begav sig in i krig emot Polen. De skipade dock kvickt fred emot Ottomanerna och Novgorod, och till slut beh√∂vde den barmh√§rtige kejsaren kliva in och s√§tta ner foten med sina kejserliga arm√©er. Kostnadsfri fred blev f√∂rhandlad, och hela Europas fruar och d√∂ttrar jublade och bad en b√∂n f√∂r v√•ran vise fredsfr√§mjande Kejsare. 
Europa har nu avnjutet flera √•r av frid tack vare Kejsaren och hans allierades hj√§lp. Tyv√§rr √§r det n√•gra som inte kan n√∂ja sig med fred, och de nordtyska staterna b√∂rjar mumla och grumla om deras position i livet, vilket √§r v√§ldigt f√∂rn√§mt under kejsarens beskydd.

So I've run quite a few solo campaigns, and honestly I prefer them to regular games with 3-5 players. Solo campaigns are much more personal, detailed, and involved than full party games, since you only have one person to focus on and you can spend all your time on them. 
A lot of people want to write Epic or High Fantasy plots for their DnD campaigns. Something along the lines of ""the evil wizard Wizgammon has stolen the ancient artifact from the plane of power and is using it to invade the innocent realm of Mundania, won't you please stop him?"". Don't do this in a solo campaign. Your plots should be focused on that character. Dig into his backstory for inspiration on where to start. In a group campaign, flavoring your fighter with a desire to duel all the fighting masters of the land in honorable combat is a side quest and distraction at best, and useless fluff at worst, but in a solo campaign, it can legitimately be the entire campaign. Your problems shouldn't be world spanning, they should be personal. 
Figure out what the player likes. In a group campaign, you have to have everyone meet in the middle, but in a solo campaign, you can tailor the campaign, challenges, encounters, puzzles, and everything else to the liking of that player. You said he's a fighter, but is he a rebel leader running an underground resistance, while struggling to feed, clothe, and equip his rebel fighters (and their civilian families!) while spying on the ruling regime, running guerilla attacks to disrupt their operations, and talking to his lieutenants in between missions to try to figure out who's the spy in their ranks that keeps feeding intel to their oppressors? Is he a soldier in a regular military unit, who eventually rises through the ranks to become a warlord of his own, who still has to take orders from higher up, and give them out to his men, as well as ensure their wellbeing, instill discipline and order, and worry about tactics during battle? Or is he just a freelance explorer and pilferer of ruins, crypts, and tombs the world around, amassing personal wealth while risking danger and becoming involved in intrigue from others who seek the prizes he claims, a la a DnD version of Laura Croft? 
I've listed these things first solely because I see them be done the ""wrong"" way so often. Now, I'm not saying that this is the wrong way to do this, and there's certainly no objectively right way of doing things, but to do them well in a solo campaign is much harder than a group campaign, and I'd advise shying away from those world-spanning plotlines and epic characters and encounters; at least your first time.
So, the three pillars of DnD are interaction with other PCs, the world, and NPCs, exploration, and combat, and not necessarily in that order. Again, tailor your campaign to your player, but I'll talk about general stuff that applies to all 3. 
In a solo campaign, there's no interaction with other PCs because there are no other PCs, so that's out. Interactions with PCs in group games tend to be more impersonal than in solo campaigns. You can form meaningful relationships with NPCs more easily, make a network of friendships and business associations, get references or gossip from people you know rather than just a skill check, or have people to go to when you need something, rather than [class] or [occupation], as it normally boils down to in a group. And you'll need stuff from other people much more often, since you don't have a rounded team of PCs. Depending on your relationship with the player irl, this is also probably the only time where you can roleplay marriage, romance, or sexual things without it being creepy or inappropriate. 
Don't speak in the passive voice; it kills roleplay. Don't put the PC in situations where the player is incentivized to speak in the passive voice. If they're alone in the wilderness, then they keep a daily journal, or they have a dog/hound/wolf companion that they speak their thoughts to by the fire when making camp. I actually like the journal idea period, and anytime I have a player who's down for it, I have them do one per session, written in character, on the events that transpired over that session, regardless of whatever else is going on in the campaign. Giving the player a DM companion can also work, but be mindful that you're not a player and shouldn't play the character like one. They're there to support the PC, act as a springboard for them, and serve as a way for the player to interact with someone without having to talk to themselves. You should never take the spotlight. 
""I check for traps."" How many times have you heard that phrase in your previous three men party? While exploring the world, a locked door is not an obstacle to be overcome for a solo fighter; it's a side quest, or a call for creative solutions. You need to rethink the challenges that you set in front of your player, and think of the tools they have available to them. Opening locks, disarming traps, reading magical runes, detecting auras, scrying, tracking, curing diseases and poisons, healing major wounds, being captured or incapacitated, **ever**... these are all things that a fighter has no natural capacity to deal with by themselves. 
As always, magical items, especially scrolls and wands, can overcome anything, but those aren't going to be easy to come by at low level. You can give them the ability to pick locks and detect traps innately, or give them a companion that has all those utility skills, or let them hire from among a group of mercenaries, all of which have some but none of which have them all, or just not put locks and traps in your game. I mean, sure, the treasury and prison of a castle would still be locked, but that's obvious, and just because it'd be immersion-breaking if it wasn't locked. 
Anything else that needs to be difficult to enter can be guarded.. by guards. Or if your fighter is acrobatic, provide a way in your level/dungeon design that allows them to get around using that. If they're charismatic, provide an opportunity for them to talk their way through a barred door, or befriend a goblin who knows a secret way. If they're keen and observant, or well connected and pay attention to gossip, they may already know about that secret way before they get there. The point is that you *can* put in locked doors, traps, magical obstructions, or other things that need stuff the fighter doesn't have, but they're going to get stopped by each lock, trip every trap, and not detect invisible magic and not be able to manipulate the obvious magic. Don't put in traps because dungeons always have traps, put in meaningful traps, and a way for the fighter to overcome them, preferably multiple ways. 
DnD is about tactical combat. Compared to other games, it's **really** about combat. There are a limited number of things you can do with DnD's framework in a solo game, since the game just assumes that you have a full party. If the player finds it fun to just play their character without any other players in combat, then you need not worry about that, and can just focus on the mechanical aspects of it. Always remember that action economy is both the most precious and OP thing in the game. One big tough guy is a challenge, but 5 weak guys is deadly to a solo fighter. Anything that causes crowd control, like stuns or freezes, are absolutely devastating to a solo player and effectively make the CR infinite if they are repeatable effects. If you're sending more than a few enemies at the player, they usually need a cleave or whirlwind effect to be able to deal with them, even if they're individually weak. If you're sending a small number of enemies at the PC, then give them abilities or interesting mechanics, and higher-than-average health, like every fight is a miniboss. Action economy works both ways, and these enemies should also have resistances to CC themselves, or the fights will be trivial for your fighter. 
If your player is like I predict, and they get bored of ""I hit this guy, then this guy"" in combat, then you can mix it up with chaotic or interesting battlefields (you're on a field of shifting sands/ranged enemies on moving platforms that you jump between and hide behind walls while doing so/scaffolding on a construction site that starts collapsing beneath you as you fight), adding in third party unfriendly-to-everyone monsters (as you're fighting the bandits, a wild, territorial boar appears from the copse of trees and begins to charge at both of you!), or just simply adding in companions or mercenaries. They can be controlled by you, or the player. 
I actually had one campaign styled after the Monster Hunter series, where the player played their character full time but on difficult hunts, would bring along extra characters that he only played in combat. We actually liked the gameplay of that so much that he just started managing an entire party after a few sessions of this, and would roleplay his main character all the time, and tell me what the others were doing when it was relevant or when he would send them off on a task, and then combat was just played straight, as if it was a full team, only one person was controlling all the PCs. 
Needing to heal in combat is going to be necessary, but for everything else, if it's going to fuck the player over, don't put it in. There shouldn't be ""save or die"" mechanics. If the player dies, who the hell is going to rez them? If the player gets captured, who is going to rescue them? If these things are possible, then maybe an angel should be looking out for the player, or something like that? Something to stop the game from immediately ending, should the worst happen, without ruining tension by removing the risk of death completely.

in a solo campaign theres no interaction with other pcs because there are no other pcs so thats out interactions with pcs in group games tend to be more impersonal than in solo campaigns you can form meaningful relationships with npcs more easily make a network of friendships and business associations get references or gossip from people you know rather than just a skill check or have people to go to when you need something rather than class or occupation as it normally boils down to in a group and youll need stuff from other people much more often since you dont have a rounded team of pcs depending on your relationship with the player irl this is also probably the only time where you can roleplay marriage romance or sexual things without it being creepy or inappropriate 
dont speak in the passive voice it kills roleplay dont put the pc in situations where the player is incentivized to speak in the passive voice if theyre alone in the wilderness then they keep a daily journal or they have a doghoundwolf companion that they speak their thoughts to by the fire when making camp i actually like the journal idea period and anytime i have a player whos down for it i have them do one per session written in character on the events that transpired over that session regardless of whatever else is going on in the campaign giving the player a dm companion can also work but be mindful that youre not a player and shouldnt play the character like one theyre there to support the pc act as a springboard for them and serve as a way for the player to interact with someone without having to talk to themselves you should never take the spotlight 
i check for traps how many times have you heard that phrase in your previous three men party while exploring the world a locked door is not an obstacle to be overcome for a solo fighter its a side quest or a call for creative solutions you need to rethink the challenges that you set in front of your player and think of the tools they have available to them opening locks disarming traps reading magical runes detecting auras scrying tracking curing diseases and poisons healing major wounds being captured or incapacitated ever these are all things that a fighter has no natural capacity to deal with by themselves 
as always magical items especially scrolls and wands can overcome anything but those arent going to be easy to come by at low level you can give them the ability to pick locks and detect traps innately or give them a companion that has all those utility skills or let them hire from among a group of mercenaries all of which have some but none of which have them all or just not put locks and traps in your game i mean sure the treasury and prison of a castle would still be locked but thats obvious and just because itd be immersionbreaking if it wasnt locked 
anything else that needs to be difficult to enter can be guarded by guards or if your fighter is acrobatic provide a way in your leveldungeon design that allows them to get around using that if theyre charismatic provide an opportunity for them to talk their way through a barred door or befriend a goblin who knows a secret way if theyre keen and observant or well connected and pay attention to gossip they may already know about that secret way before they get there the point is that you can put in locked doors traps magical obstructions or other things that need stuff the fighter doesnt have but theyre going to get stopped by each lock trip every trap and not detect invisible magic and not be able to manipulate the obvious magic dont put in traps because dungeons always have traps put in meaningful traps and a way for the fighter to overcome them preferably multiple ways 
dnd is about tactical combat compared to other games its really about combat there are a limited number of things you can do with dnds framework in a solo game since the game just assumes that you have a full party if the player finds it fun to just play their character without any other players in combat then you need not worry about that and can just focus on the mechanical aspects of it always remember that action economy is both the most precious and op thing in the game one big tough guy is a challenge but 5 weak guys is deadly to a solo fighter anything that causes crowd control like stuns or freezes are absolutely devastating to a solo player and effectively make the cr infinite if they are repeatable effects if youre sending more than a few enemies at the player they usually need a cleave or whirlwind effect to be able to deal with them even if theyre individually weak if youre sending a small number of enemies at the pc then give them abilities or interesting mechanics and higherthanaverage health like every fight is a miniboss action economy works both ways and these enemies should also have resistances to cc themselves or the fights will be trivial for your fighter 
if your player is like i predict and they get bored of i hit this guy then this guy in combat then you can mix it up with chaotic or interesting battlefields youre on a field of shifting sandsranged enemies on moving platforms that you jump between and hide behind walls while doing soscaffolding on a construction site that starts collapsing beneath you as you fight adding in third party unfriendlytoeveryone monsters as youre fighting the bandits a wild territorial boar appears from the copse of trees and begins to charge at both of you or just simply adding in companions or mercenaries they can be controlled by you or the player 
i actually had one campaign styled after the monster hunter series where the player played their character full time but on difficult hunts would bring along extra characters that he only played in combat we actually liked the gameplay of that so much that he just started managing an entire party after a few sessions of this and would roleplay his main character all the time and tell me what the others were doing when it was relevant or when he would send them off on a task and then combat was just played straight as if it was a full team only one person was controlling all the pcs 
needing to heal in combat is going to be necessary but for everything else if its going to fuck the player over dont put it in there shouldnt be save or die mechanics if the player dies who the hell is going to rez them if the player gets captured who is going to rescue them if these things are possible then maybe an angel should be looking out for the player or something like that something to stop the game from immediately ending should the worst happen without ruining tension by removing the risk of death completely continued in a reply to this comment because im hitting character limit",-0.334108043565047,-0.124108567950733,334.434271880761,-456.594705340813,0.053958648512355,0.0131114473020676,0,47,0.0267349260523322,60,0.0341296928327645,2,0.00113765642775882

IMO They should go 1 of 2 ways. 
If they want to keep with the jack-of-all trades vibe, the best thing they could do is give all 3 classes access to All equipment, and then give each of the classes built-in perks that make them better or more useful while using said equipment, also removing a perk slot or 2 in the process.

That means that they keep their ""everyone can do what they want"" vibe and still make your class choice matter.
My personal favourite is option 2, basically locking other classes out of certain things while increasing specialty to the max.

Just don't let me run around with an AR / Fulton people etc. Same goes for an enforcer, I want to be a huge brute with a massive machine-gun, why can I fulton people/mark people.

what makes knicks fans what phil gone is not whats going on with melo its his infatuation with the triangle and his remarkes in the closing press conference that he was going to actively become more invovled with coaching the triangle thats not how a president of basketball operations runs a fucking team if hes not the coach and it screams to nba players fans staff media etc as a clown show and i can bet you that hornecek will not last under that guise and so that will be the 3rd coach thats fired under phil in not even a complete 5 seasons",-0.684607606494051,-0.19103421211703,98.7130813286685,-92.0030787657739,0.105105105105105,0.018018018018018,0,4,0.0131147540983607,5,0.0163934426229508,1,0.00327868852459016

"2239",5395,"The OP above has the right idea. If you have the time and money though, along with a brisk walk and a change in diet, I would recommend strength training three times a week: push on day one (shoulders, chest, triceps), pull on day three (back and biceps), legs on day five. Take the weekend off, do abs any day you'd like (they tend to heal faster), and make sure that at least one day a week is a total rest day: no work related stress or strenuous exercise. But diet and sleep are very important. Also, water. Drink it, a lot. This is the routine I started with when I was obese and it worked great. Building muscle is something that a lot of large people (especially women) overlook when they decide to diet and exercise.

"2441",26541,"Let me help you. First, in your finding is undoubtedly a great story line. What we have to dig into, is how much of it is proof that the person who did it was really a murderer. Understand that I am NOT for innocence or guilt, I just recognize a police railroad when I see one.


&gt;&gt;His purchase of handcuffs and ""shackles""

They sound better as a weapon when you say LEG IRONS. They have NO bearing on innocence or guilt simply because there is NOTHING but a story line that connects TH to SA. NOTHING. Can you say a man is indeed guilty just because you found that he bought fuzzy pink shackles.... perhaps from a company who has made 3 million pairs in the last year, quite simply because capitalism obviously dictates how many people out there must buy them and get a kick out of them ? Sorry, a normal person can't or at least shouldn't.

&gt;&gt;the actions of a good level headed man is not to run someone off the road at gunpoint, no matter the circumstances.

He has never been a ""good and level headed man"". He went to a school SPECIFICALLY for what was referred to as ""retarded"" people. THAT is what it was called at that time, so do not blame me. I assure you he had been ridiculed all his life. I'd understand perhaps if he NEVER reacted like a ""good and level headed man"" based on his surrounding family or circumstances. While that event seems to be pretty well documented, it is CLEAR that he had a relative that routinely bullied him, and happened to be a friend of Police Dept. employees. It is certainly not a stretch to understand that there would have already been friction between Avery family members and the Police dept because of this. Given that the relative admitted to LYING about what Steve was supposedly doing, it is very possible that someone in his capacity dealt with this BULLY the only way he knew how. So, without knowing more and more about everything from Steves actual mental condition, to the level of bullying he received from this person, can you use this to absolutely know he killed Teresa ? I can't. And, I'm sorry, we all love fuzzy cats, but not everyone who did something bad to a cat has turned to killing people. There is no automatic anything there.... none. I obviously does not help him regards the story line... I get that.


&gt;&gt;being surrounded by hardened criminals

Can't argue that, but, first, WHO Put him there ? There are PLENTY of things about that case to show the Police railroad service in action... PLENTY. Secondly, has every man released from prison become a killer..... no, so that doesn't have any bearing. Do threatening letters to a wife who is leaving you thru the fault of the state indicate that you are a killer ? not to me. Sorry. If you want INTENSE PRESSURE, I bet that was incredibly difficult to take and I bet there are PLENTY of men who have written or said things when it was happening to them that are not killers. It does add to the story line. I get that. But again, I'm not mushy with this stuff. I'm a realist, and really ? This does not bear any evidence that he killed Teresa.

&gt;&gt;Teresa's fear of Steven

Wow. To me, this one is almost an emmy award winner. NOTHING really indicates that she FEARED going there other than Kratz's insane, known to be untrue pre-trial and post-trial rhetoric. The ONLY think ""creepy"" about this part of the story is that it seems to be a FANTASY being lived out by the kind of guy who would SEXT young girls. This is so overblown.... ""they laughed"" and she said ""ew"". THAT is all you have. Even her phone messages left PRIOR to her coming there were sweet and innocent and without fear.... ""call me back"" ! She said...... but they want you to think Steve was ""Stalking"" her. There is ZERO proof of stalking. But it is good for a story line. MEDIA loves this kind of stuff.


&gt;&gt;Steven Avery specifically called and ask for Theresa to come that day (under a false name).

I order crap from various companies. I ALWAYS ask for the person I dealt with in the past because they know me, they know already what I probably want, and they have done it for me before. This is not creepy. It certainly does not mean a man is a murderer, especially the *67... Heck, I have received phone calls from the POLICE that have BLOCKED THEIR CALL to me ! Does that instantly mean they are a killer ? The false name falls dead flat too. If he was stalking her and he did not want her to know what she was getting into, WHY LURE HER THERE to start with ? So many people come and go from that PUBLIC BUSINESS that you want me to believe he was so smart he could clean up every last stitch of blood and DNA from ""shooting her in the garage"" but too stupid to lure her elsewhere or even deep into the salvage yard right away rather than in his front yard. It does NOT make him guilty. But, does fit the story line of a sex addicted drug freaks fantasies quite well (IMHO). (I'll puke if I see Kratz talk about ""sweaty man"" one more time).


&gt;&gt;Avery is also accused of sexual assault of a family member.

Allegedly.... and once again, thank the very same police force for not getting to the BOTTOM of that issue. It never progressed passed ""alleged"" according to available documentation. Sad for that girl if true, but again, if you want fault, it drops right back to the police for not getting it documented. Perhaps something will jar Colburns memory now, 12 years later, and he will file a report on it ? I am truly saddened that a young girl of 16 may have been ""raped"". The problem with ""rape"" today is that a willing 16 year old girl is not held accountable for HER actions, only the BOY is supposed to know all the rules, even a retarded boy. There is MUCH to the actual reports on the issue that you just have to say, ""did the cops fail this girl more than anyone"" ? We can't tell. And ""rape"", be it alleged, or accused found guilty, sentenced, and exonerated STILL does not prove you murdered Teresa.

On a side note, THERE IS NO THING AS SWEAT DNA. Sounds good, but there isn't. Just another thing from the professional liars association. There is DNA that can be transferred from sweat, and that DNA can be obtained from practically anything a person touches or has touched. Heck, you could put your girlfriends ""Sweat DNA"" on something just by rubbing her socks on it. Cops had PLENTY of old socks (not to mention they admit they don't change gloves when jumping from one specimen collection to another) 

Well, it's been fun going over this again and I do agree, it is all sad. It's messed up. I'm neither in the guilty or not-guilty camp. No one should be publicly. We do not know. MOSTLY I am sad because at minimum, police in this whole fiasco tend to always fail to do their jobs CORRECTLY, and as such, Truth is never really found... justice never served. Only thing served is the higher up's egos. Powerful men they are.

"2456",286,"Great question. Money and inflation are closely related. 
Inflation is basically the general increase in prices &amp; fall in the purchasing value of money. In the history of money, there has been a tendency for the issuer (typically the government) to make more money. The thinking is that by issuing more money, it may make people feel wealthier, and therefore want to spend more money, which should lift prices. For example, in Ancient Rome, silver coins were used as currency, but officials debased this money by issuing more coins that had lower amounts of metal. In other words, they were issuing more money, but less valuable money. Since paper money was invented, arguably in the Tang Dynasty in China, issuers have historically issued more money, trying to invoke inflation. In my book, I go through the history of paper money from Tang Dynasty, The rise and fall of the Yuan Dynasty in China, Eighteenth Century France, Colonial money (in one chapter). All too often, governments pursue a policy of inflation, print too much money, and then there's a financial crisis. Borrowers like inflation because when the time comes to repay the loan, they will pay in money that's less valuable. So governments that borrow a lot (think US, Japan) actively pursue a policy of inflation -- and they can do this by trying to control the amount of money in the economy.

Sure, many who are suicidal would find another way to kill themselves, but the data all seem to suggest suicide by firearm as the preferred method. Perhaps due to accessibility, ease of performing the actual task, the lack of a drawn out and painful death as could be seen in other methods (slitting wrists, hanging, etc.) Of course, all of that is only true if everything goes according to one's plan.

sure many who are suicidal would find another way to kill themselves but the data all seem to suggest suicide by firearm as the preferred method perhaps due to accessibility ease of performing the actual task the lack of a drawn out and painful death as could be seen in other methods slitting wrists hanging etc of course all of that is only true if everything goes according to ones plan still though its silly to suppose number of suicides wouldnt go down at least a little bit

You can support different sides of the same argument with [polls](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/20/mainstream-polls-show-americans-with-donald-trump-on-immigration/). Many other polls show Americans are with Trump on a number of things, part of it is how you ask the question!

&gt; Progressive Except Palestine-PEP. A term many of us know and have used to describe someone who has a commitment to progressive causes-civil rights, human rights, movements for justice-except when it comes to Palestine and Israel.

&gt; Being Progressive except Palestine not only means supporting Israeli brutality-it really does mean that-but it also means supporting US imperialism.

&gt; To say Progressive except Palestine makes it seem as if crimes against Palestine and Palestinians are an aside, not central to what makes someone a progressive, ethical person-as if you can say you adhere to principles of justice except for this &amp;quot;One small&amp;quot; thing.

I have a lance with 782 raw, 420 water, one slot, and 40 purple sharpness with sharpness+1. 

I have another with the same raw/sharpness but it has two slots and no element (I keep it to use as a spot-filler in how I organize my weapons, and it ended up being useful for this theory, ha).

One with 690 raw, 450 ice, two slots, and 40 purple sharpness with sharpness+1.

One with 713 raw, 450 dragon, two slots, and 20 purple sharpness with sharpness+1.

A gunlance with 782 raw, 500 ice, one slot, and 20 purple with sharpness+1.

It seems that the better stats are in one place the worse they are in another. If I give them point values (3 for best, 2 for ""decent"", and 1 for ""shitty"") it looks like a rare 9 relic can't go above 9 points. Coincidence?

Raw: 782 is 3 points, 713 is 2 points, and 690 is 1 point.

Element: 470-500 is 3 points, 420-450 is 2 points, and none is 1 point.

Sharpness: Natural purple and 40 with sharpness+1 are 3 points, 20 purple with sharpness+1 and 10 purple with sharpness+1 are two points, and everything else is 1 point.

Slots: ooo is 3 points, oo is 2 points, and o is one point.

....

The ice gunlance, for example, has amazing raw/element (782 and 500), decent sharpness (20 with sharpness+1), and an awful (one) number of slots. The points add up like this for those stats: 3+3+2+1=9

The two slot (2 points), max raw (3 points), 40 purple with sharpness+1 (3 points), but no element (1 point) lance also scores a 9 (2+3+3+1). 

Some score lower (8) and I know that rare 9 relics can score less than 8, too, but I'd guess that they can't go higher than 9 points using the system I just pulled out of my ass.

"3343",12224,"Lol, that's bullshit. Success is a repeatable formula that anybody can do. People just refuse to try, research it, or even spend the time looking into it. They just assume they're going to fail. They're too busy making excuses about why they're going to fail that they don't even look into any of the countless opportunities available to them that take little to no startup capital. 
The funny thing is, you don't even have to improve your skill set. 
You could, for example, take $300 and hire a bunch of VAs to research trends in the app market for you and provide you with their findings, pick a couple of ideas, spend another $600 hiring conractors to develop the app for you, and then spend another $400 marketing it for a pretty common ROI of $20,000 over a three month period and then scale up your process. 
Hell, I know a guy who hires VAs to research niche Kindle book markets, hires somebody to write 10,000 words on those niches, and then puts them on the store and hires more VAs to market those books for him and he nets about $10,000 a month. 
Drop shipping is another great option, arguably one of the easiest things to get into. 
For example, in your spare time you could pay $200 for somebody to build out a Shopify store for you. 
Then, you could spend an afternoon looking up - let's say - manufacturers who make luxury chess sets (a niche product that isn't dependent upon brand and that appeals to upper-middle class with disposable income). 
Then, you just reach out to t hose manufacturers and get anywhere from 2% to 10% to agree for you to sell their products on your site. 
Then, you simply hike up the price about 20%, advertise on Google Shops for about $1,000 in your first month, and whenever you get an order you forward it to the manufacturer who ships it direct - you never have to handle or ship product. It's exactly what retail stores do, but without owning a building or housing the literal wholesale product and you simply charge retail prices. 
I mean... I could go on and on. It's not even a losing bet on most of these strategies. It's just a simple formula. I have plenty of friends who have two or three drop shipping stores and net around $15,00 to $20,000 a month in largely passive income (they just manage their VA team). 
It's absurd for you to think this is some kind of entrepreneurial undertaking with a 90% failure rate. 
I can pop off about another 15 strategies for making easy money online with barely any startup capital right now that involves no learning curve, a pretty much guaranteed success rate, and no particular skill set necessary. 
People just don't even want to try. They  just want to complain. They don't even fucking look into it. It's insane to me. Absolutely insane. 
When I travel I'm surrounded by Digital Nomads who are all doing this, and they just followed the same formulas as everybody else. 
Hell, I tried out Teespring.com a couple of months ago and netted $7,000 in one week and three hours of work off an EXPERIMENT. 
All I did was hire someone on Fiverr.com to make me a niche logo (targeting males over the age of 45 who were interested in fishing) and created a witty little design. 
I then created a Facebook ad campaign targeting those users, and sold about 250 shirts over an 8 day period. Teespring just gives you the money and ships the shirts. I spend about $1500 in advertising. 
Easy peezy.

you could for example take $300 and hire a bunch of vas to research trends in the app market for you and provide you with their findings pick a couple of ideas spend another $600 hiring conractors to develop the app for you and then spend another $400 marketing it for a pretty common roi of $20000 over a three month period and then scale up your process 
hell i know a guy who hires vas to research niche kindle book markets hires somebody to write 10000 words on those niches and then puts them on the store and hires more vas to market those books for him and he nets about $10000 a month 
drop shipping is another great option arguably one of the easiest things to get into 
for example in your spare time you could pay $200 for somebody to build out a shopify store for you 
then you could spend an afternoon looking up  lets say  manufacturers who make luxury chess sets a niche product that isnt dependent upon brand and that appeals to uppermiddle class with disposable income 
then you just reach out to t hose manufacturers and get anywhere from 2 to 10 to agree for you to sell their products on your site 
then you simply hike up the price about 20 advertise on google shops for about $1000 in your first month and whenever you get an order you forward it to the manufacturer who ships it direct  you never have to handle or ship product its exactly what retail stores do but without owning a building or housing the literal wholesale product and you simply charge retail prices 
i mean i could go on and on its not even a losing bet on most of these strategies its just a simple formula i have plenty of friends who have two or three drop shipping stores and net around $1500 to $20000 a month in largely passive income they just manage their va team 
its absurd for you to think this is some kind of entrepreneurial undertaking with a 90 failure rate 
i can pop off about another 15 strategies for making easy money online with barely any startup capital right now that involves no learning curve a pretty much guaranteed success rate and no particular skill set necessary 
people just dont even want to try they  just want to complain they dont even fucking look into it its insane to me absolutely insane 
when i travel im surrounded by digital nomads who are all doing this and they just followed the same formulas as everybody else 
hell i tried out teespringcom a couple of months ago and netted $7000 in one week and three hours of work off an experiment 
all i did was hire someone on fiverrcom to make me a niche logo targeting males over the age of 45 who were interested in fishing and created a witty little design 
i then created a facebook ad campaign targeting those users and sold about 250 shirts over an 8 day period teespring just gives you the money and ships the shirts i spend about $1500 in advertising 
easy peezy

"3461",2215,"I agree about Ockham's razor. I think its much more accurate to speak of models (an ensemble of interrelated beliefs) rather than beliefs in isolation. But beliefs in isolation are still useful to speak of. And so what are the consequences of an instrumental notion of belief, and the fact that beliefs are interrelated have on justification for a belief?
Some points that need to be reconciled:
(1) It seems appropriate that a belief that has no consequences for our world-model should be decided based on a preponderance of evidence (e.g. what day of the week it is) 
(2) It seems inappropriate that a belief that has severe consequences for our world-model should be decided on a preponderance of evidence (Gods, simulations, orbiting teacups).
(3) It seems meaningless to claim a belief in something while disavowing any consequences of this belief (e.g. I believe in God but I'm not going to change my behavior because I might be wrong).
(4) It is preferable that our rationally decided behavior should move continuously towards the ideal rational behavior, no matter what the order evidence is received.
How are these points to be reconciled? One such criteria might be that we forgo consideration of beliefs in isolation, and instead judge a model in its entirety. And so belief in God is judged by the model of the world that results in accepting the proposition vs the model with its opposite. This analysis would inherently require a significantly greater amount of evidence to ascend to belief in God precisely because of the consequences it has for one's world-model. In cases where there are no model-breaking consequences (day of the week type things), then this analysis reduces to simply a preponderance of evidence.

1 it seems appropriate that a belief that has no consequences for our worldmodel should be decided based on a preponderance of evidence eg what day of the week it is 
2 it seems inappropriate that a belief that has severe consequences for our worldmodel should be decided on a preponderance of evidence gods simulations orbiting teacups
3 it seems meaningless to claim a belief in something while disavowing any consequences of this belief eg i believe in god but im not going to change my behavior because i might be wrong
4 it is preferable that our rationally decided behavior should move continuously towards the ideal rational behavior no matter what the order evidence is received
how are these points to be reconciled one such criteria might be that we forgo consideration of beliefs in isolation and instead judge a model in its entirety and so belief in god is judged by the model of the world that results in accepting the proposition vs the model with its opposite this analysis would inherently require a significantly greater amount of evidence to ascend to belief in god precisely because of the consequences it has for ones worldmodel in cases where there are no modelbreaking consequences day of the week type things then this analysis reduces to simply a preponderance of evidence

The whole show is narrated like a historical documentary, we get the narrator's moral judgements and analyses throughout the show, which is exactly what history is. We don't get to see everything that a more personal story would show. While facts don't change, history aka people's view of the past definitely does. Now that the war is decidedly over people will be able to view what happened and decide what things mean to them. We can't necessarily understand the true impact of something while it happens, or be unbiased enough to understand why it happened. Like Lebelo didn't really see where the FPA was going and made some bad choices due to that. There is new knowledge out there for people to reflect on now that people can take a step back.  Now that the legend has ended (the war) the story of Reinhardt or Yang is no longer theirs but instead humanity's to make of as it will. 

I think it's very fitting with how the average fan feels after finishing the show. You feel like you  just watched the defining moments of your era and now it's all gone and you are only left to reflect. A big theme of the show is people not understanding history and fucking up because of that, the final words to me are the period at the end of the sentence that is the show and that sentence is, ""Learn from history, because while it doesn't repeat, it certainly rhymes.""

I'm just gonna C&amp;P my response from an AskReddit thread yesterday.

Sometime obesity researcher here. I did my master's thesis on the effects of diet on obesity and food preferences.

A lot of obesity research uses the ""DIO"" (diet induced obesity) model. In this model, some rats are fed a high-fat diet and become obese, while others are fed normal rat chow. The two groups can then be compared to draw inferences about causation (instead just correlation), because there is a control group. 

Among other things, diet induced obesity produces reduced responsiveness to low levels of palatable substances (i.e. sweet and fatty foods). This is accompanied by normal or elevated responsiveness to high levels of palatable substances, meaning that the subjects are more likely to ignore moderately calorie dense stuff in favor of the REALLY calorie dense stuff. The same has been found in humans (although obviously in human research you've got ""correlation doesn't imply causation""). 

The upshot is that obesity almost certainly reflects dysregulation of food intake, due at least in part to exposure to extremely palatable foods. What does that mean for ""calories in - calories out?"" It means that while weight gain / loss is of course determined by intake - expenditure, there's no avoiding the fact that there's an Olympus Mons sized mountain of evidence that consuming highly palatable food (i.e. junk food) affects an individual's subsequent ability to effectively regulate their own caloric intake. Artificial sweeteners are probably bad for your ability to regulate, also.


So... If you want to lose weight our avoid gaining weight, stay away from junk food, especially soda. It won't make you any fatter than a calorically equivalent amount of other foods, but it WILL screw with your ability to regulate your own dietary intake in the future.

Sugar is addictive.

"4357",34723,"Before I dropped out of college, I was going to a university that had a *major* reputation of being a party school, to the point of having once been rated ""#1 Party School"" by Playboy or something to that effect.  Now, I didn't live on campus, so I avoided most of it just by being a commuter, but I still have a story about this:
All incoming freshmen had to attend a three-day (IIRC) orientation.  I had kind of a strange situation/case, as I had taken classes there as a dual-credit student in HS, and had amassed enough credit hours that *officially* I was coming in as a ""degree-seeking"" student as a sophomore, which allowed me to circumvent the requirement of living on campus for a semester, so I was relieved to think that I could get out of this also.  Nope, no such luck.  I played frustrating phone tag with the administration and vigorously pleaded my case every which way, to no avail.  They told me unequivocally and firmly that I would be required to attend this orientation.  ""But technically I'm a sophomore!"" I said.  ""But I'm not even going to live on campus!"" I pleaded.  They didn't care.
So I'm already in a sour mood going into this, and then I discover that it's mostly hours upon hours of alcohol education, for *multiple days in a row*.  Seriously, well over half the orientation was dedicated to alcohol.  They had cheesy, poorly-done scenario skits about sexual assault on alcohol that only served to severely muddle the issue, and they literally had presentations on what to do in the event of alcohol poisoning if someone started to turn various shades of different colors.  There was a brief talk about time management and campus resources, a quick safe-sex reminder that was totally heteronormative and as such didn't really apply to me anyway, and then alcohol this, booze that, drinking harm reduction the rest of the time.
I was *irked* to say the least.  Irate, even.  (I take prescription drugs on occasion now, but...) I really *was* a teetotaler then-- wasn't even prescribed psychiatric meds of any sort, and didn't touch psychoactive substances aside from caffeine at all.  Basically the whole orientation I was stupidly required to sit through was useless to me.  I realized shortly afterwards that this was probably all done for liability reasons--there had been *many* incidents of alcohol-related arrests, ridiculous shenanigans and a few poisoning deaths in recent years at the school, and I suppose they wanted to ensure that parents couldn't try to sue.
I'm all for harm reduction, but the whole thing inherently *assumed* that we would all be drinking at some point, and that we would all be doing so in the most irresponsible ways possible.  It probably even *encouraged* alcohol consumption as a result, it was over-the-top, and it shouldn't be required for students who don't even partake.",0,"before i dropped out of college i was going to a university that had a major reputation of being a party school to the point of having once been rated 1 party school by playboy or something to that effect  now i didnt live on campus so i avoided most of it just by being a commuter but i still have a story about this

For this to be true requires a serious mangling of the left-right spectrum as it is ordinarily defined. In loosest terms the Left is revolutionary and progressive, they want to change and transform existing institutions. The Right wishes to preserve them. 

What passes for the left-right spectrum in recent NZ politics is closer to a doctrinal dispute among revolutionary progressives about what kind of radical change is for the best. The left-wingers you refer to want redistribution of wealth for what they take as the collective social good. 

The pseudo-right of the National Party wants to enact transformation by eroding the existing social and cultural institutions in favor of a politically borderless and economically homogenous global order centered on the interests of elites, mainly in the US and the UK. This is a very recent development, since the 1980s and 90s, and it coincides with the predominance of neoconservative policies in Western nations, which assimilated a revision of classical economic liberalism (""neoliberalism""). This is ""right-wing"" only in name, and it undermines the division into right and left to begin with.
