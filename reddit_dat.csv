"4436","Disclaimer: I am a committer at Apache Flink, and my knowledge of Flink is deeper than my knowledge of Storm and Spark.
With Storm: Storm is a data streaming engine. Flink supports batch data analysis, and (as of recently) data streaming analysis. The APIs of the two systems are also different. Storm's API revolves around spouts, bolts, and topologies, whereas the streaming API of Flink revolves around data streams, and windows on streams. 
With Spark: The APIs of Spark and Flink are similar to a first degree of approximation, both based on concepts from functional transformations on collections that are parallelized by the systems. A difference is how the backends of these systems execute these APIs. For an intro to how Flink's backend does that, I recently gave a presentation on the internals of Flink that is available here: http://flink.apache.org/material.html

"37673","Great write-up. Thanks...  
&gt; I think the situation is not as bad as we all are making it to be.  
You are right, it isn't. But...  
First of all we were spoiled a bit. We were ready to start celebrations before Başakşehir game. We got kicked in the nuts. Not just by the score but by the way they out played us. So that was a bummer. But we still had a chance to overcome that unpleasant feeling by winning against FB. And we got kicked again. This time it was worse though. We did it to ourselves.   
Now at this point it isn't about our strength or quality of our players/game. It's completely pyhcological. I know there are FB/GS fans that want us to win instead of Başakşehir. But other than that most of the actors in this game (rival clubs, government, TFF, media) will be against us. We know that. Or lets just say we feel that. We also know we are not that good enough under pressure. Yes we won last year but we had a great, experienced duo (Gomez, Sosa). We have Talisca and Aboubakar instead of them. And simply put, we now know that they are not that good enough under pressure :(    
Talisca will likely to get, at least 2 match ban. Maybe it won't be a problem against Bursa and Kasımpaşa. Maybe it won't be a problem at all. But this will re-enforce that ""us against everybody else"" feeling. And that feeling will put us under more pressure. So it will hurt us one way or another. I'm not even going to start getting 3rd star...
So our problem is managing and using that pressure. And up to this day we weren't that good at it. That's what worries me. Not the fixtures or the way we play. Good thing is after FB game first thing came to my mind was last years Akhisar game. Lets hope the affect will be the same...",0

But what makes this interesting, and even funnier, is that Marvel constantly censors what he's saying: Sometimes his violence is censored, too:Just because we don't see the exact expletive Deadpool is muttering or the sheer scope of the violence doesn't mean either's effect is lost.

"27774","&gt; What's so special about next year? Is it just a matter of letting coach Mac have ""his guys"" in place for the offense he wants to run?
To me, next year is the measuring stick because there will be no more excuses. Mac will have his hand-picked QBs and supporting cast running the offense. If at this point next year we still look like dog shit on offense, then we have a legitimate problem. 
&gt; I don't agree with the sentiment that it's reasonable to give a guy three years to display basic competence on that side of the ball
It is reasonable in my mind given the current circumstances surrounding our team. When Mac inherited this team, we had 1 capable QB on the team (Grier), and we saw flashes of greatness with him in his limited time here. Then you look at the other 3 QBs we had as options: a glorified WR (Treon), a walk-on backup transfer from Oregon State (Del Rio) and a graduate transfer from Purdue with a career sub-60% completion percentage (Appleby). You could make an argument for throwing the freshmen in there, but at a certain point in the season, I think Mac committed to redshirting them and that is fine. True freshmen QBs are a fickle bunch.",0

"37914","When the Bolton men had their aside, Lyonel had unbuckled the black leather belt that held his sword and parrying dagger on it, and wrapped it before they turned around. He'd dropped it to the floor to show the guards he meant no cause to draw either. 
Before they had finished their whispering Lyonel had already begun to undo the first buckle on his long coat. When Domeric gave the order, Lyonel only sighed. ""I was hoping this would go differently. It seems I'll have to bare it all out here."" 
""I finally understand the kind of man you are, Lord Domeric. I can tell you care about your daughter, and your son. But you seem to misunderstand the kind of man I am. You called me persistent. If I was just persistent, my lord, I'd not have spent the last five years sleeping on a mattress on the stone floor of a basement office while I recovered from having my ribs six in six places all while repairing a decrepit building.""
""If I was persistent, I'd not have met with the rank and file of the Gold Cloaks, befriending the ones I found to be trust worthy. Spending time with them, learning about them, their families, their friends, and the people of this city they knew and loved."" 
""If I was persistent....my lord, if I was *just* persistent than I would not have donned a disguise every afternoon, I would not have spent a small fortune over the last five years providing food, clothing, and medicine to the urchins and beggars. The downtrodden and forgotten. All of this this just to unravel the deception of the person who had started this war between our people's.""
By now the long coat had been fully unbuckled and it slid easily enough off of his shoulders, crumpling on the ground. Beneath, Lyonel wore a black and gold vest over a white shirt. However, despite the fine make, and the preservation found in the care of the shirt, it clashed fiercely over the forearms or the shirt. Unlike the cloak, the shirt he'd worn that day, his finest shirt, had not been repaired. 
The shirts sleeves from the elbow lower were colored a dark reddish brown, the color of dried blood, that somehow matched the fresh pink scars that covered his forearms. 
""A persistent man would have given up long before then. Long before, and most certainly after the sealskin plague struck this city. He would not have seen the suffering of the smallfolk he had come to know. He would not have done everything he could to find out about the plague, and then sought to care for them. All the while justifying that he needed to do this to get the information from them, but knowing that from the moment he saw...he saw the children and new born babes suffering from it, he couldn't turn his back on them.""
""A persistent man, who had not slept in three days would not have, when hearing that the house, the very steps of which you stand now, had been struck with the plague. He would not have approached this house in disguise, and he would not have treated your men, some of whom you may be asking to throw me out, would not have treated the young maid, and most importantly, when he saw your daughter..."" Lyonel paused as he looked up to the window that was Roslyn's room. The one Benedict didn't even know he already knew where it was. ""...on death's door, about to join those who had past on. She was so pale, her bed and shift soaked in sweat, my lord. She could hardly breath and her skin felt as though dragon fire was under her skin.""
""A persistent man would not have held her close, nursing her back from that cliff's edge. He would not have whispered his pleas to her, begging her to stay. He would not have stayed at her side, holding her and coaxing her to health until the fever broke. A persistent man, after all this, would not have returned back to the smallfolk.""
The son of Stryfe returned his gaze to the Highlord of the Dreadfort as he rolled up his sleeves to show the full extent of his scars. 
""A persistent man would not have...he would not have used his alias and his connections to find the men who attacked Lady Whent and started this recent blow up between our kingdoms. And he would not have ordered himself to be attacked in order to draw them out into the open.""
""He would not have been able to use those he knew could be trusted among the Gold Cloaks to assist him, and when eight men attacked him, a persistent man would not have endured the assault enough to have them men all apprehended to be interrogated. And he would not have finally found the person responsible for what began this entire debacle to begin with.""
""A persistent man would not be standing now before you, sharing this with you, telling you he has risked his life, his liberty, and his sacred honor. All to be before you today. He would not offer himself to be your hostage, and he would not be willing to marry a woman who not only has chosen another man before, but who he still loves despite everything.""
""I told you I knew what kind of a man you were, or rather the kind of father you are. You are a father willing to save your daughter's good name, and that of your family's, to ensure no one ever knows what the result of her dalliance with the Ki- with Bael."" Lyonel corrected himself. ""So much so you will marry her to a man whom for the rest of your days you can exert control and pressure to ensure that you control the narrative of the event. Likely one of the reasons I found Benedict in the bar some time ago is because it's far more acceptable for it to be the result of what he'd caused.""
""My lord, I have accepted pain, I have accepted suffering, and I have accepted defeat. I accept Roslyn, not as I knew her or met her. But as she is, who she is. And that includes what she has done and the result of it."" Lyonel told Domeric, his blue-green eyes may have well been grey, as the intensity of his trial bore forth like a freshly steel blade. 
""I am not persistent, because if the persistent fail, then there is solace in such failure. I *persevere*. I find a way."" ",0

I do use external tools and my mods are clean (with a few intentional ITMs to override other mods), I just don't want to enforce the use of SKSE when SKSE is usually just a cop out anyway.

Some mods need SKSE or else they would be impossible (anything involving modifying form properties or getting and setting spell/enchantment magnitudes, hence Wintermyst). Other mods require SKSE because they are just SKSE function flips.

But other than those, SKSE is just a convenience for the mod creator and a barrier to entry for the newbie user who is asked to install an untrusted .exe and surrender their Steam launch button before they can even begin to use mods, making them more likely to go ""eh, there are enough other games around"".

That said, do you have to confess anything to your wife to re-install covenant eyes? Couldn't you just say you've been tempted, you want to ensure your purity, and if she wants she can be your accountability partner or a trusted friend from church can do it. If she asks you can tell, with discretion of how much detail she wants.

Oftentimes men want to confess to their wives to make *themselves* feel better: coming clean, getting it off my chest, etc. But it's emotionally devastating to wives and can often cause more harm than good in the relationship. This is why men challenge men in issues like this. It largely depends on what the wife can handle but in my experience most women, especially Christian women, do not understand the struggle. ",0

How about if they add a skill called super blade, and it hits in a line in front of you dealing 10,000 damage to all enemies, wouldnt that be cool? then plds would be the best dps. give it a 2.5 second cool down. then plds can out dps the whole raid. thats what plds need right guys? instead of shield oath they should just have sword oath and double sword oath, that way you can have a stance with two swords and deal double the damage. you dont need more mitigation to beat savage, what you need is more dps. having two swords(one in each hand) will help you do that.",0

In a hotel staff usually just have to clean out a coffee maker.  But with a whole home you also have to clean out the microwave, oven, stovetop, full size refrigerator, toaster oven, coffee maker, unload the dishwasher, and then reorganize all the cabinets full of dishes, silverware, pots and pans, supplies - that get put back anywhere, etc.  Then there are the dirty items guests put back in the cabinets that have to be hand washed.

Yes, they do. It's called overtime. Your dad probably doesn't get it because he is a director so owns a share of the company or gets some kind of profit-related bonus. Therefore by working longer hours and ensuring better profits for the company he gets his reward that way.
&gt; Why are doctors any different?
Because the NHS is not commercial enterprise. They don't get bonuses or profit-shares, unlike those in business. 
Also a director of a construction company is not making life or death decisions throughout the day. Although I can't believe his performance is optimal with such long hours. Can't he delegate?",0

"14405","That does not go against smart game development.  The current echo chamber about what smart game development is goes against smart game development.  There are systems that need optimization that would not be completely broken and risk being too entrenched as features are added to be optimized later.
For instance, structures are a huge source of lag in this game that will need to be addressed to improve performance.  Finding a way to make structures exist that requires fewer resources sooner improves gameplay for everyone.  Not doing so leaves the risk that, as more structures and objects in the gameworld are added, structures begin to make calls to functions that are poorly managing memory.  Optimizing structure memory use at a later date then risks breaking many structures, requiring each broken structure to be investigated as to why it does not work under the new structure code.  The alternative, of figuring out and fixing the reason that structures cause so much lag now, then adding new structures later with the fixed model, saves time overall as there is no need to redo things after drastic changes in the code.
New content doesn't really risk breaking optimization outside of its area of the code.  A new creature or item, for instance, won't affect chunk loading unless the coder is completely incompetent, which isn't the case here.  If it does something radically new, it might point out a flaw in some of the code it calls, but that's something that probably should have been taken care of when first implemented.  The efficient resource use in the code needs to be part of the code from as early a point as possible.
If anything, optimizing later risks breaking more things in the game than doing it earlier.  It also has a tendency to just never happen.  The real reason they put it off is because new features are fun, for fans, the media, and developers.  Fans feel like nothing is being done if the devs spend a month on optimization, the media doesn't put out any articles advertising the game if nothing new is added, and it's just plain boring for most devs to go back and look at what they did when they have some cool, new idea buzzing in their head.
Optimizing during development is the smartest way to do things because you can maintain good/acceptable performance while never letting the backlog of systems that need to be optimized get too long.  The key thing people have to admit is that development never stops.  After release there will either be continued content patches, DLC, or work on a sequel/successor.  Then optimization gets put off longer or delegated to a skeleton crew that can at best slowly improve the issues baked into the code, risking breaking huge parts of the final code as they try to chase down a memory leak or some poor management of pointers or so on.  Enough time goes by and they become more useful working on the next game, and the cycle continues...",0

This seems like common fucking sense.
Edit: my plan is to go into a Lowes and buy some of the goods they provide. If it so happens that another store has those SAME goods for a cheaper price then I plan to pay the lower price. THERE IS NO DOWFALL TO THAT PLAN

"18025","Aeroflot is fine from New York. Planes are relatively new, economy seating is decent (and I'm also 6'3"") and the food is edible. Flight attendants still wear large hammer &amp; sickle patches which is sort of nuts. 
Transiting at Sheremtyevo in Moscow is easy, no need for a transit visa or anything. Great people watching there too if you have a long layover. 
If you're looking to go the other way around, I know Hainan recently launched a Boston-Beijing route that they're having trouble selling. They partner with JetBlue here in the States, and I've seen some dirt cheap fares from NYC-BOS on JetBlue and onto Beijing with Hainan. People who fly Hainan swear by it &amp; you buy it as a single ticket. 
Good luck.

"860","See, there is an inherit flaw in this line of thinking. And that is that communist are trying to find ways to bring a stateless and classes society about. But that is faulty thinking, as a communist shouldn't see it that way. Instead, it is viewed that a stateless and classless society is the synthesis of having the proletariat dictatorship, not that it is strived for but the result of changing the relationships of the means of production. This is what makes anarchist and communists different, why the communist found a path to be progressive and as a result see where it leads, anarchist want to go somewhere without any path to follow.",0

"3253","in my humble opinion, y not merge the games so we can play pc games on xbox one also? people already get super excited for pc ports on xbox one. the only value of an xbox one is i can get those kind of graphics for $350 instead of a $1000 on pc. thats the only significant advantage because and its surrounding the almighty dollar and there arent real dealbreakers other than that. i prefer my xbox one just because of the aaa game selection but it cant compete with pc to me overall and thats obvious for those who can afford it. on pc, theres just less monopolies. they both can coexist with pc gamers having a custom experience and xbox players having that already tailored experience. pc already has a million times more games than xbox one so i dont know why people would ever want to compete. steam just has tons of games coming out daily. i think its just this pointless and futile competetion holding xbox back. a steam app on xbox one would just be amazing and i hope they do it. 
BUT to answer what your specifically asking in xbox games only heading to pc and no pc games coming to xbox, then, yes it would devalue it except for the price thing. ",0

He did nothing of note at ManU, went to Sunderland, did nothing there, went to Leads, had some mild success there, but fell out of form and was put on wavers, went to QPR and sucked there, went back to Ireland and didn't do much there, went to Australia and sucked for a bunch of teams, and then found his way to Wilmington. Also sounds like he's had discipline issues at a number of clubs. I don't really recall him doing much in the match last night, only Wilmington player that stood out was their #10 who was fast as fuck and a constant thorn in our side. ",0

Combat Maneuver: You can do some combat maneuvers. Since Telekinesis is a spell, it does affect Incorporeal beings, since spells and spell like abilities can affect them (though at reduced damage). All incorporeal beings are immune to being tripped or grappled, but you could bull rush or disarm one using telekinesis.
Violent Thrust: I would say you definitely can, since it specifies that it can affect creatures, and the ghost is a creature whom magic affects. I do agree it wouldn't hurt the ghost at all to crash into anything solid, since it remains Incorporeal.",0

"27712","I have always avoided elections and politics because of two reasons. The first is that they do not appeal to me in the slightest; I have no strong opinions over the major 'issues' that each party sides on. Second, it turns people yucky. Even my own friends become unfamiliar to me as they blurt their opinions left and right as if anyone else cared. It gives me a wretched sour taste. 
However, because I am American and voting is expected of me, I did a crash-course research session yesterday, learning all there is to learn about the candidates, and finally picking my 'side'. Then I voted, which made me feel accomplished. Then I endured the night, and it was terrible ... back and forth, my nerves were frayed. 
Next morning, it's a battlefield on social media. Friends are being very rude and disrespectful (from both political sides). The winners are bragging and saying ""stop being so soft, demmies!"" and the losers are whining and name-calling. It's terrible to see the condition of humanity. I am not one of these people ... I revert to my hole, trying to maintain positivity, but it indeed is difficult. Especially now that we have an entirely un-sensitive president. 
These are just my opinions and feelings, and I respect everyone's opinions (as long as they are communicated respectfully) but I cannot relate largely to the country I live in. People may jest and say, ""Well why don't you change countries, har har,"" and that sounds appealing. Not because I'm trying to run away from anything, but because I just don't feel like I belong here. Does that even make sense? Like an ugly duckling. Or a kitten amidst a family of Porcupines. 
EDIT: Speaking of porcupines, the reddit name is a conjunction of ""preoccupied porcupine"". It refers to the society we live in, where people are porcupines and words/actions are their quills.

Both are more aimed at doing damage against a single target.  So even with a Mag priest buffing them, they're only being buffed against one of the Hydra heads basically.  
Now bring in your pally... Who has 2 AOE attacks.  You're problem is basically highlighting the benefits of AOE damage when fighting Hydra.
If you have some decent SSS allies that do AOE damage and aren't deifies, you may see a notable increase in damage if you take out Tracy or Gaela and use them instead.  At least till you can get some good AOE dpsers like others mentioned below.  Lly, Brightspark, etc.  I'm using Tinuvian maxed and Kymael in Omega +1 as my primary DPS and I'm pulling 117 mil with Mag Priest.  Which goes way above what my pally can do.

In person,  she was the stereotypical fat girl: big, puffy face; frumpy dress with a bow on the back; too much make up and perfume and jewelry;  etc.
I was nice. I had been busting my ass at work and I was kind of glad just to be out. Our waitress (hot,  skinny, older redneck girl) said we looked ""cute together"" and I almost vomited. I guess she was trying to throw her sister an assist...?
I was surprised by how unattractive I found her... it's like, as the weight goes up,  attractiveness goes down exponentially or something. It wasn't just the weight, it was the whole desperate package.

"18143","I think the intricacy of the malazan series is what hooks me, and part of that is the massive amount of detail that went into the creation of the world. It was originally intended for a role playing game I read somewhere once. So the basis for the world that these characters inhabit has rules that are consistent and secrets to uncover about how it all works and so on and it's just... It hits me in the happy place. 
Richard Adams writes books that similarly hit me in the happy place. They are stand alone novels, and they are incredibly political but they are excellent. Maia is my favourite, though Shardik runs a close second. 
Wheel of Time is epically long and somewhat as... Involved? As Malazan but in my opinion not as well written. There are points in the series where it's obvious to me that the characters ran away with the tale so to speak. 
Sword of Truth is also similarly long, and the thread of the tale wanders a bit, but it is certainly not as well written and gets very preachy with the authors ideals at time, and really sordid with some of his factions who's purpose is seemingly only to vent his BDSM fantasies and not at all necessary for the tale. I mean he could have written said faction in such a way as to make it necessary, but he didn't bother. It's a good 'trashy' ride though. 
A Game Of Thrones is excellent but as of yet unfinished. 
Robin Hobb and her Farseer books are an excellent journey, though not as intricate as the Malazan books. She write several short series revolving around the world the characters inhabit two of which I believe follow the fate of one character, and two of which follow the fate of another major player in his story. It's been a while so I don't recall exactly how many. They were fun though!

Like you pointed out, yes, it's pretty easy to write world building in a *natural* way when you have an *audience surrogate* because those are supposed to be *you* and together with them, you will learn about that specific world. It's quite cheap and is more often than not badly done (i.e.: character is from certain profession who doesn't know how stuff works on the said job)

"15695","I used to feel exactly the way you describe, and I still see the same facts. In terms of the universe as a whole, yes, my actions are largely insignificant, but they are NOT unimportant.
I am one of the very few parts of the universe which has an active, conscious experience of my existence. And I have that for a limited time. What a wonderful gift! It seems to me, you are defining ""point"" in some vast cosmic sense. Sure, there's little point in that. But why not narrow it? You have an experience, as does everyone else on this planet. I look at the ""point"" of my existence right now as trying to improve the experiences of the people I come into contact with. Paradoxically, when I do that, I feel far better about myself and my own experience. I find meaning and happiness and purpose in my own life, and I'm creating a lasting effect on other people, because they become inspired to help others the same way.
(Martin Seligman gives a TED talk on the subject if you're curious, about ways to find happiness in life--scientific research suggests strongly that the best way is to live a life of meaning).
So sure, you may not have a huge, universal purpose, but why not try to make the lives of those around you better? What's the alternative, doing nothing, or making their experience *worse*? Although you may not be able to impact large scale phenomena, you can certainly have an impact into the people around you, and that to me is a purpose.
(The books ""Morality Without God"" by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and ""The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World"" by Owen Flanagan are two good books on the subject if you want an atheistic perspective. If you're interested in a more spiritual bent, without a traditional God concept, then ""A New Earth"" by Eckhart Tolle is also good reading).",0

&gt; * Libya's Red Crescent has said that 74 bodies of refugees have washed ashore in the western city of Zawiya on the Mediterranean Sea.
&gt; * Under the new plan, the bloc would provide Libya's government with funds to increase efforts to stop refugee boats from crossing territorial waters, and to ""break the business model"" of traffickers who helped 181,000 refugees enter the EU through Libya and Italy last year.
&gt; * An estimated 230 people, not including the 74 found on Tuesday, have died en route to Europe since the start of 2017, according to the United Nations.

"917","It depends on the nature of the job you've been called in to do.
A lot of agencies prefer to have freelancers on-site as you're closer to the account and they can monitor your work. However, on smaller jobs I've worked remotely.
The duration of the job will determine if you'll sign a contract. Contracts are signed if an agency expects you'll be on an account for a long time. Otherwise, you'll be told how long you're likely to be needed. More often than not you'll be asked to stay on, unless you're a monumental fuck up and they want rid of you.
Without a contract there's nothing connecting you to the agency, which is why the sans contract option is, in my experience, more common. Either party can throw in the towel if it's not working. Do a good job and they'll find other uses for you within the agency.
An agency will hire a copywriter for several reasons: they may have won an account that requires a copywriter on-site, seen an increase in the frequency of work coming in or, as is often the case, sacked their previous copywriter and failed to find a replacement.
The role varies from agency to agency and depends on the account you'll be working on. Copywriting can be anything from writing press releases to formulating content calendars for a social media campaign. Anything that involves words the customer will read falls under the copywriter's remit.",0

"27031","Giving an honest response I don't see how that PBS video would cost 2-3 k for the production step. I doubt anyone doing an educational video would actually hire an actor to memorize a script. They(should) get or already have someone who knows what they are talking about, and then make sure he follows bullet points. But maybe he is a spokesperson reading a prompter of some sort he looks like he might be.

That shoot didn't even require any fancy shooting it's just a camera on a tripod anyone somewhat competent with cameras can do.

So all the person is looking for is either studio rental time for like an hour, very minimal set up is used, so they have access to a solid color background wall/paper, which is normally green, and 1 semi competent person to set up the camera and make sure audio is fine. You normally can't rent out a studio for just an hour usually have minimal half day to full day. So they plan more than 1 shot.

Studios come with the competent person to help initial set up and the camera normally. If someone is charging 2-3 k for that part for something as simple as that then they're over charging by a factor of 10 or more.


Now the editing part is pretty well done. I don't know if those graphics were already in some public repository somewhere(they probably were), or if they were made just for that. The editor for that probably spent maybe 8 hours for those 10 minutes and was decently skilled. This depends on how much pre-planning was in it though. So he can charge $50 to $100 an hour. Assuming very little pre planning and he made the story himself.

A lot of pre-planning went into that though which took up most of the time. It normally should be the person who is hiring these people who do these pre-planning steps. Though someone who doesn't have a clue about what types of pre-planning needs to be done should team up or hire someone who does have a clue, that part could get as expensive as the editor and that is where the director is needed. That advice is usually also given out freely if you purchase studio time. It's pretty much only writing a script, story-boarding, and giving a repository of graphics that you want used.

I do know it's becoming the trend to overcharge on everything because there simply isn't enough work to go around and make a living off of it. But I don't agree with that.. I like giving honest answers. If high skills are necessary then they should charge whatever they want. But to over charge on something something as easy as a stable camera on a tripod and claim it's something highly technical to do. Just begrudges potential and current customers.

Why can I say all of this? I don't have 10+ years of experience but I do have 3+ years of experience at a tv studio and editing room which was rented out daily. My job was jack of all trades and I was always that semi-competent person who were on these 1-3 stable camera interview/green screen type shots, grip, audio etc. I was also the semi-competent editor who sometimes only followed the cut and paste storyboard that someone else already put together for me. If it's all planned out exactly then anyone can do the job. I became competent enough that I took my own jobs and still stuck to the single camera stuff. Even went into the film industry as well and attempted to start my own studio.",0

"21123","Well, I literally don't know how to study because I almost always can't form a complex argument. Like, I'm doing relatively fine in calculus 2 now (we are learning ODE's now and it is starting to get harder, at least for me). I did fine on sequences and series, but to be honest I still feel I don't know anything. If I had to prove anything besides than just checking if a series converge (and not any series!) I won't because then I would have to remeber some kind of theorem that I simply don't. I don't know how to explain. Some things I can remember well, but it is just hard to keep track of concepts, definitions and see it all together. Usually you build one concept or definition and then you build another on top of the first one and that's how math works. Then you link it all together and bam, you got something else and that was the whole point of it. Well, that's just hard to keep track, and in the end I end up understanding nothing at all. Or nothing useful. I can remember some details, but it is useless without the big picture.  
I made a mess for you to read, sorry. I had to stop and rethink because I literally forget while typing what was the point I was trying to make.  
  
Oh, this also affect me in other disciplines, for example, when I was studying for some kind of governament exams we have here in Brazil, so it has a lot of law stuff. Well. I simply can't. Lots of laws and details and damn constitution and whatnot to keep track. I simply can't understand any of it.
I do have a learning disability, but Idk exactly what. It was supposed to be ADD and other stuff that doesn't help either (anxiety, depression etc), but ritalin does nothing at all, antidepressants are almost always useless. Etc.
The only good thing I got from antidepressants was that last year I got a little more social and I met a girl at campus and a few months later... bam. It was great! 
On the other hand I'm also doing fine in my programming class. Well, I got a really bad grade on the first exam, but everything else is really fine. And the teacher said I can retake that exam.",0

"1690","&gt; I'm not exactly sure how might makes right.
Might is the *only* thing that makes right. There is no right and wrong unless you have a way of protecting and enforcing your chosen ethical axioms.
Look at EU for example -- the economic leverage that 27 states have against any single dissenting one is huge, and this forces everyone to play by the rules even in cases where it might hurt their national interest or specific industries. Without a common currency and market, there would be no barrier to states treating EU laws as more of a ""guideline"" and implementing them selectively, whenever they feel like it.
Might is the only thing that can force countries to forgo pursuit of their own interests at the expense of others. Not even the most enlightened European states are going to do this out of the goodness of their hearts and an inherent sense of fairness -- they will only ever do it when the cost of dissent is too great to pay. 
This is why international law, as it stands, is bollocks. There is no law without a court, and there is no court without binding, enforceable decisions, and there's only one way to enforce things. ",0

"10919","[[Sorin, Solemn Visitor]] is a type of card called a Planeswalker. Those +1 and +6 numbers are the ""loyalty costs"" of a special type of activated abilities that Planeswalker permanents have called ""loyalty abilities"". When a Planeswalker enters the battlefield, it comes with a certain amount of loyalty counters equal to the number in the bottom right corner (where the Power and Toughness would be on a creature); these loyalty counters are used to pay the costs for the loyalty abilities. For this version of Sorin, his starting loyalty is 4.  
You can only use a loyalty ability during your turn when the stack is empty (basically, not ""in response"" to something else). Each Planeswalker can only be used once a turn, so you have to decide which of the (usually) 3 abilities to use each turn. You pay the cost by adding or removing an amount of loyalty counters equal to that + or - number in front of the ability and then it goes on the stack, like any other activated ability. If the Planeswalker runs out of counters, it's put into your graveyard, kind of like a creature with 0 toughness.  
Planeswalkers are the most complicated type of permanent in the game, but they can be very powerful as well. I've given you a simplified version of the rules about how to use their activated abilities, but there are a few other in depth rules about them that you'll want to learn about as well if you plan to use any in your deck, I'll let some other people explain how they can be attacked with creatures, or damaged by spells and other affects.",0

"5956","The problem of evil assumes that God and evil are fundamentally incompatible. God cannot be debunked based on his supposed characteristics. A version of God can be debunked in this way. If I were to tell you that God is the creator of all existence and that he is entirely good- incapable of what we refer to as evil, then you would have a solid case against that God. We observe evil to exist.
So, God is not a father-figure protector God that can easily be defined. It is not, in any way, logical to assert that *no* God exists based on the fact that the protector concept of God cannot exist.
If God created the universe, then obviously, everything that we can observe in the universe is traceable to God and inseparable from Him. The existence of evil does not disprove God or even show that He is ""bad."" Perhaps, the fact that we would even make an assertion of that nature only proves that we lack the wisdom necessary to create an effective universe. What would our experience be if we only had access to the polarities that we prefer? Good and no evil? Warmth and no cold? Bliss and no suffering? Love and no hate?
There would be no evolution. No wisdom. No opportunity to learn and grow.
So, my point is that we should stop assuming that we are in a position to define the nature of Being itself. We should stop assuming that our failure to understand is proof that what we wish to understand does not exist. We should stop trying to force things to fit in our model rather than altering our model to allow for our empirical observations.",0

Either way, if a lower resolution scanner were used, yet could still provide the same data format, it would just cause the Touch ID to not work, as its function is dependent on detection and identification of details (called ""minutia"") in fingerprints. Security wouldn't be compromised at all.
Please remember that banks and the electronic payment card industry use some of the stupidest security standards in all of tech. Banking still relies heavily on a ""security through obscurity"" model, which is great for causing headaches, and not so great for improving security.
Banking is also full of half-brained security ideas. Look at PCI DSS and the requirements of compliance. A lot of their requirements clearly were not thought out by true security professionals, but by idiots who merely considered themselves to be more technical than the average user. DSS has a number of totally useless requirements, while skipping right over many more important things that offer significantly better security benefits while being far easier to implement.  I don't even know how Apple pay can qualify at all, anyway.
If this idea for serialized finger readers did come from the banking industry, I would actually believe it.  They are the only people so stupid to innocently come up with this.  If not, I totally believe Apple is out to screw you in the name of security.",0

"39656","The fact is, as other people have noted, the attention span isn't what it used to be. With smartphones and computers, we can inhale so much media at such speeds that sitting down to watch a 3+ hour race simply doesn't seem as reasonable to many people. NASCAR won't be able to change that fact, unfortunately. That trend will continue to snowball. 
The flip side of that is that people who don't sit down to watch a whole race may stream it online, or use other forums to keep tabs on what is happening in the sport. 
We're naïve if we think a decrease in people sitting for 3.5 hours straight to watch an auto race means our sport is on a death spiral. All of us here are indicative of this fan base, and none of us seem to desire to walk away from this sport. There may be less people watching the full event on Fox every week, but with the sheer volume of viewers, have faith that NASCAR will be able to remain in the public eye and continue to attract sponsors. 
If I'm not mistaken, viewership for other sports has begun to stagnate as well. Maybe we can attribute that fact to the commercialization of the world as we know it and the fact that nothing is ""pure"" anymore. That is true. Everything is about revenues and profitability. NASCAR too. That's why our venues and event formats have almost no turnover from year to year. 
If NASCAR truly cared about expanding its fan base and drumming interest, they would genuinely pursue new venues that could attract new audiences. The conglomerates that control the race venues don't allow for such a dynamic. 
If you truly have a gripe about the current state of our sport, listen to fans literally all over the internet across a plethora of forums: they feel NASCAR doesn't listen to them. NASCAR attempts to draw interest by changing the playoff structure and race format, and publicizing drama such as the Busch-Logano fight, but what fans really want is a different dynamic. Fans want to see something different than a cookie-cutter oval for 40% of the races, where only the horsepower teams have a legitimate chance. I think most of us on this forum are smart enough to recognize that fact. 
NASCAR won't see a reversal of fortunes as long as that remains the case. We continue to be miffed by the indicators that say less people are paying attention, but the answers are pretty clear. 
Consider it from this angle though: are Bruton Smith and the France family going to be harmed if NASCAR falls apart? Certainly not. They already have many lifetimes' fortunes safely tucked away in their bank accounts, and there is still opportunity to increase their childrens' trust funds. Nothing will truly change until profitability goes away entirely or NASCAR is in shambles. Enjoy the ride, I say. This commercialized reality is the best we'll get. 
No. There is no circumstance under which viewership increases. Those are the sad facts. ",0

You have to engage them. Attempt to refute/attack their arguments, and gauge their reaction. If they shift goalposts/build strawmen/etc: call them out. If they do it more than once, or attack you rather than your argument: fair enough to disengage.

Ignoring them or demonising them, if they are sincere in their beliefs, will only fester their misguided opinions. This is because they walk away believing they are still right, as their opinions have not been challenged.

And in a public forum such as this, others that hold similar beliefs will feel vindicated. They can easily dismiss down votes as ""brigading"". However, a nuanced response can attempt to crack the wall of cognitive dissonance.

China's 'unicorns' nearly double to 131: official
2017-03-27 08:25Xinhua Editor: Gu Liping
China had 131 billion dollars worth of private start-ups by the end of 2016, nearly doubling the figure of the year before, said an official with Ministry of Science and Technology.
Zhang Zhihong, director of the ministry's Torch High Technology Industry Development Center, made the remarks while opening an institute for small and medium enterprise research in Tianjin over the weekend.
He used the term ""unicorn,"" rarely used by Chinese officials, which refers young, unlisted companies with a market value of over 1 billion U.S. dollars, based on private funding sources.
China's unicorns are spread over 16 cities, but mostly in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. The majority are innovation-driven tech businesses, Zhang said.
A report published by the torch center earlier this year said half of China's unicorns are in Beijing's Zhongguancun, home to China's three super-unicorns worth over 10 billion U.S. dollars: Xiaomi, Didi Chuxing, and Meituan.
One third of Zhongguancun's unicorns were born after 2014. They focus on four domains -- e-commerce, culture and entertainment, Internet finance, and transportation, according to the report ""Development of China's Unicorn Enterprises in 2016"".
In fact, Zhongguancun is second only to Silicon Valley as the most concentrated area for tech unicorns in the world, the report says.
Zhang said a pro-innovation business environment, conductive policies, and good services are key to the growth of unicorns.
""Unicorns have become important engine to maintaining medium-high growth and to transforming industry,"" Zhang said. ""Their emergence is key to development of the sharing, smart, and platform economies.""

Here is what I'm not going to let you do! 
I will not let you tell me how I think and feel for real victims. I however think that SP isn't a real victim. 
If at any point she was held against her will and hurt that isn't ok either. No matter if she was on a bender or ran off with someone. 
You're girl has a past history of self harming and attention seeking. When you cry wolf all you're life, people second guess what you are saying! I'm surprised nobody ever told you that story. 
I don't think she was severely beaten. Sorry. I've seen someone severely beaten so I take that very serious. 
As far as her weight goes. I'm surprised that you would think a hospital would let someone go who was malnourished or dehydrated. It doesn't happen! That much I know. SP was very thin before she left! I'm about her height and size and people can also wrap there arms around me a couple times. 
Next! 
Why are you here? Are you just checking out public opinion? Are you trying to gage the way the pubic feels about Sherri?
You seem very passionate and connected to this case. So why in the world do you care what a group of people think if you KNOW it's true??? 
If I were you , I'd be camped out at the sheriffs office asking for results! I would have Sherri go back and do a composite sketch of these alleged perps. 
If you truly truly believe you're girl Sherri, then you are wasting you're time here. Go get a group together to solve this crime! Shit if you gave us true evidence that she was taken, I bet half the people here would jump on board to help! 
You have never once said! Please help us! Please help us push the cops to get this solved! 
You have only wagged you're finger at people who have doubts because there are so many things wrong with this story.

"39982","The dark knight (rises? Idk...the one with the joker).
It was before the sudden surge of superhero movies we've seen recently , so my view of superhero movies was still : “ They show us a problem, they show us how OP strong the hero is, problem solved“. You know...like all those stories whose main purpose seems to be to show off how strooong their main character is.
Then came the bankrobbery in the beginning with its twists and all (i laugh every time at “no i'm gonna kill the busdriver“ , “what busdriver?“).
But i was still not quite convinced because i thought i would still turn out one sided AF.
But then the whole movie shows the villain and main hero in a head to head race until the very end. And even the end itself is not just the run of the mill happy end but rather tie/draw in some way. +They also gave non primary characters enough screentime to give the viewer a little bit more insight in what people were doing aside from the main characters (For example the scene with the two ships with explosives on them works pretty much without the main charscters interfering even though they eventually still do ofc). It's not like my fav movie of all time now but i still was quite positively surprised.

My mother had two bachelors, one in nursing and one in finance, so our money management and income were always not a problem.

I learned to love myself after taking mushrooms because I realised that I can literally choose what I think of myself. You can be critical and judge yourself, or you can love yourself unconditionally.
Mushrooms helped me realise the most important person in my life will always be myself. Because no matter what happens or who I meet, other people come and go, but you are always in your own presence right up until the end. So how will it help hating yourself? It makes no sense.
Mushrooms have a way of letting you view common problems in your life with a completely new perspective. It allows you to remove your own prejudices and biased judgement from your pattern of thought. So you see problems clearly, and the solution appears obvious, as if it was always staring you in the face.

This leads to men looking at teenagers the same way they have for a millennia and now they're all pedophiles.

Not everyone's going to be sheep and contribute to a fucked system when more and more data shows the fed's system of global banking mafia is getting exponentially worse and worse for the masses. The trend will continue. At least we're finally in a time where we have the technology to replace the old system with a new one.

People believed the nonsense lies before when the internet didn't exist. 20 years later and data shows more and more we are ruled by greedy psycopaths that want more and more like a disease. They manipulate and orchestrate all governments behind bias media that pushes their agenda.

Thank God the internet and hackers are bringing this to light. We can finally set things straight for humanity and move us towards a better path.

We all know breaking the system will cause global panic and suffering for many. However, I think it will change no matter what. All old systems become obsolete as new data and technologies show us better ways. Gives us tools to create new systems as a society.

Globalism will come, but not at the hand of these corrupt powers ruling our worlds. Thanks to technology, data, and a rising global awareness humanity will overcome and enter a new age of prosperity once the better system evolves into place.

Until then we all try to make the best of it. Spread truth, peace, and knowledge while staying informed.

Österrike fortsätter sitt långa arbete att skapa fred i Europa, och bibehålla den ömtåliga Europeiska maktbalansen som är så viktig för att förhindra storskaliga krig, svält och misär. Men ibland måste man gå till krig för att förhindra mer krig! I  försvar till alla kejserliga gränsstater så var Kejsaren ödmjukt tvungen att bege sig i krig mot Frankrike med resten av kejsardömet. 
En episk allians av rättfärdiga krigare som slogs för Europas säkerhet, det slutade med att den Franska konungen såg vishet i fred och gav upp sina pretentioner på den Engelska och Burgundiska kronan. Österrike bad inte om något i detta avtal förutom fred, och kan heller inte ansvara för att Provance girigt utpressade Frankrike på mer territorium. Ett lågt pris för världsfrid.
Efter kriget med Frankrike så gick det rykten om att kejsaren stödde Republiken Novgorod med guld för deras försvarskrig emot den aggressiva expansionistiska maktalliansen Sverige-Polen-Litauen. Detta förblir enbart rykten, men om kejsaren hade gjort detta så hade det självfallet varit rättfärdigat, då Republiken enbart försvarade sitt hemland mot främmande invasion. Novgorod brände dock sina fält och lät fiendearméerna svälta, vilket gjorde kriget till kostsamt för den mörka alliansen.
Gud bestraffar dock dem som ger sig på de som är mindre än dem, och det var inte långt fören ett inbördeskrig bröt ut i Byzantinska Riket, som var en nära allierad till den mörka alliansen. Ottomanerna anföll samtidigt och la belägring på Konstantinopel, samtidigt som Böhmen begav sig in i krig emot Polen. De skipade dock kvickt fred emot Ottomanerna och Novgorod, och till slut behövde den barmhärtige kejsaren kliva in och sätta ner foten med sina kejserliga arméer. Kostnadsfri fred blev förhandlad, och hela Europas fruar och döttrar jublade och bad en bön för våran vise fredsfrämjande Kejsare. 
Europa har nu avnjutet flera år av frid tack vare Kejsaren och hans allierades hjälp. Tyvärr är det några som inte kan nöja sig med fred, och de nordtyska staterna börjar mumla och grumla om deras position i livet, vilket är väldigt förnämt under kejsarens beskydd. Det viskas i det kejserliga hovet om att de är missnöjda och vill expandera till bekostnad av sina grannar och kristna bröder. Hur kommer denna tragedi att sluta?",0

Even though i haven't had any success with women, I have made moves on many of them and observed others going through that process as well. If a girl is in to a guy, or at least receptive, she makes it obvious, and, most of the time, it will be hard for him to mess it up if he at least has to courage to try. On the other hand, if a girl is not into you, she will make that clear as well. However, most of the guys on this sub have only ever seen the negative reaction, so they mistakenly come to the conclusion that girls must be very subtle and complex when it comes to flirting, though the truth is that just haven't ever had a girl want to flirt back. It would take a really talented individual to win a girl over on charm alone when she already has prejudged that he isn't worth her time. You would be better off finding ways to compensate for your deficits than trying to master the art of flirting. If you can make yourself attractive enough or successful enough, then you will find flirting all of a sudden becomes very easy.  ",0

I have trans friends in America feeling very scared about their safety right now - the last thing we need is activists arguing over who gets most time on the microphone.

Some good sketches, decent editing,  sometimes washed out black and white indie film. 
Edit : good to decent 
After watching and thinking about it:
I can see why Leo and Toby didn't want the movie out,  Leo was mostly an asshole throughout the film.   Being ""bros""  in real life, they were looking out for each others careers.   
They couldn't be associated with being a dick for no reason  (not having mental health, addiction issues) in that time in their careers.
Look at the career of the guy who played Telly, one of the the bad guys in ""kids"". 
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Fitzpatrick). 
Though to be fair, Dicaprio is much prettier than Fitzpatrick, and he was an actual actor, not a kid the director found on the street like Fitzpatrick. 
But I believe both their careers would be different had this film come out at that time.
Possibly no Toby Spider-Man, but more likely, no Leo Titanic. 
Who knows, maybe he would've won an Oscar by now, no way to tell.

"34039","Your English is not perfect but it is very readable, do not worry about it. If I say something that doesn't make sense, please ask me to clarify. 
So I've run quite a few solo campaigns, and honestly I prefer them to regular games with 3-5 players. Solo campaigns are much more personal, detailed, and involved than full party games, since you only have one person to focus on and you can spend all your time on them. 
A lot of people want to write Epic or High Fantasy plots for their DnD campaigns. Something along the lines of ""the evil wizard Wizgammon has stolen the ancient artifact from the plane of power and is using it to invade the innocent realm of Mundania, won't you please stop him?"". Don't do this in a solo campaign. Your plots should be focused on that character. Dig into his backstory for inspiration on where to start. In a group campaign, flavoring your fighter with a desire to duel all the fighting masters of the land in honorable combat is a side quest and distraction at best, and useless fluff at worst, but in a solo campaign, it can legitimately be the entire campaign. Your problems shouldn't be world spanning, they should be personal. 
Figure out what the player likes. In a group campaign, you have to have everyone meet in the middle, but in a solo campaign, you can tailor the campaign, challenges, encounters, puzzles, and everything else to the liking of that player. You said he's a fighter, but is he a rebel leader running an underground resistance, while struggling to feed, clothe, and equip his rebel fighters (and their civilian families!) while spying on the ruling regime, running guerilla attacks to disrupt their operations, and talking to his lieutenants in between missions to try to figure out who's the spy in their ranks that keeps feeding intel to their oppressors? Is he a soldier in a regular military unit, who eventually rises through the ranks to become a warlord of his own, who still has to take orders from higher up, and give them out to his men, as well as ensure their wellbeing, instill discipline and order, and worry about tactics during battle? Or is he just a freelance explorer and pilferer of ruins, crypts, and tombs the world around, amassing personal wealth while risking danger and becoming involved in intrigue from others who seek the prizes he claims, a la a DnD version of Laura Croft? 
I've listed these things first solely because I see them be done the ""wrong"" way so often. Now, I'm not saying that this is the wrong way to do this, and there's certainly no objectively right way of doing things, but to do them well in a solo campaign is much harder than a group campaign, and I'd advise shying away from those world-spanning plotlines and epic characters and encounters; at least your first time.
So, the three pillars of DnD are interaction with other PCs, the world, and NPCs, exploration, and combat, and not necessarily in that order. Again, tailor your campaign to your player, but I'll talk about general stuff that applies to all 3. 
In a solo campaign, there's no interaction with other PCs because there are no other PCs, so that's out. Interactions with PCs in group games tend to be more impersonal than in solo campaigns. You can form meaningful relationships with NPCs more easily, make a network of friendships and business associations, get references or gossip from people you know rather than just a skill check, or have people to go to when you need something, rather than [class] or [occupation], as it normally boils down to in a group. And you'll need stuff from other people much more often, since you don't have a rounded team of PCs. Depending on your relationship with the player irl, this is also probably the only time where you can roleplay marriage, romance, or sexual things without it being creepy or inappropriate. 
Don't speak in the passive voice; it kills roleplay. Don't put the PC in situations where the player is incentivized to speak in the passive voice. If they're alone in the wilderness, then they keep a daily journal, or they have a dog/hound/wolf companion that they speak their thoughts to by the fire when making camp. I actually like the journal idea period, and anytime I have a player who's down for it, I have them do one per session, written in character, on the events that transpired over that session, regardless of whatever else is going on in the campaign. Giving the player a DM companion can also work, but be mindful that you're not a player and shouldn't play the character like one. They're there to support the PC, act as a springboard for them, and serve as a way for the player to interact with someone without having to talk to themselves. You should never take the spotlight. 
""I check for traps."" How many times have you heard that phrase in your previous three men party? While exploring the world, a locked door is not an obstacle to be overcome for a solo fighter; it's a side quest, or a call for creative solutions. You need to rethink the challenges that you set in front of your player, and think of the tools they have available to them. Opening locks, disarming traps, reading magical runes, detecting auras, scrying, tracking, curing diseases and poisons, healing major wounds, being captured or incapacitated, **ever**... these are all things that a fighter has no natural capacity to deal with by themselves. 
As always, magical items, especially scrolls and wands, can overcome anything, but those aren't going to be easy to come by at low level. You can give them the ability to pick locks and detect traps innately, or give them a companion that has all those utility skills, or let them hire from among a group of mercenaries, all of which have some but none of which have them all, or just not put locks and traps in your game. I mean, sure, the treasury and prison of a castle would still be locked, but that's obvious, and just because it'd be immersion-breaking if it wasn't locked. 
Anything else that needs to be difficult to enter can be guarded.. by guards. Or if your fighter is acrobatic, provide a way in your level/dungeon design that allows them to get around using that. If they're charismatic, provide an opportunity for them to talk their way through a barred door, or befriend a goblin who knows a secret way. If they're keen and observant, or well connected and pay attention to gossip, they may already know about that secret way before they get there. The point is that you *can* put in locked doors, traps, magical obstructions, or other things that need stuff the fighter doesn't have, but they're going to get stopped by each lock, trip every trap, and not detect invisible magic and not be able to manipulate the obvious magic. Don't put in traps because dungeons always have traps, put in meaningful traps, and a way for the fighter to overcome them, preferably multiple ways. 
DnD is about tactical combat. Compared to other games, it's **really** about combat. There are a limited number of things you can do with DnD's framework in a solo game, since the game just assumes that you have a full party. If the player finds it fun to just play their character without any other players in combat, then you need not worry about that, and can just focus on the mechanical aspects of it. Always remember that action economy is both the most precious and OP thing in the game. One big tough guy is a challenge, but 5 weak guys is deadly to a solo fighter. Anything that causes crowd control, like stuns or freezes, are absolutely devastating to a solo player and effectively make the CR infinite if they are repeatable effects. If you're sending more than a few enemies at the player, they usually need a cleave or whirlwind effect to be able to deal with them, even if they're individually weak. If you're sending a small number of enemies at the PC, then give them abilities or interesting mechanics, and higher-than-average health, like every fight is a miniboss. Action economy works both ways, and these enemies should also have resistances to CC themselves, or the fights will be trivial for your fighter. 
If your player is like I predict, and they get bored of ""I hit this guy, then this guy"" in combat, then you can mix it up with chaotic or interesting battlefields (you're on a field of shifting sands/ranged enemies on moving platforms that you jump between and hide behind walls while doing so/scaffolding on a construction site that starts collapsing beneath you as you fight), adding in third party unfriendly-to-everyone monsters (as you're fighting the bandits, a wild, territorial boar appears from the copse of trees and begins to charge at both of you!), or just simply adding in companions or mercenaries. They can be controlled by you, or the player. 
I actually had one campaign styled after the Monster Hunter series, where the player played their character full time but on difficult hunts, would bring along extra characters that he only played in combat. We actually liked the gameplay of that so much that he just started managing an entire party after a few sessions of this, and would roleplay his main character all the time, and tell me what the others were doing when it was relevant or when he would send them off on a task, and then combat was just played straight, as if it was a full team, only one person was controlling all the PCs. 
Needing to heal in combat is going to be necessary, but for everything else, if it's going to fuck the player over, don't put it in. There shouldn't be ""save or die"" mechanics. If the player dies, who the hell is going to rez them? If the player gets captured, who is going to rescue them? If these things are possible, then maybe an angel should be looking out for the player, or something like that? Something to stop the game from immediately ending, should the worst happen, without ruining tension by removing the risk of death completely.

So I've never done any PayPal trades before but I want to sell my white Zombas because I need the money in real life to buy my first car. Anyways, I live in the U.K. so we use £ instead of $ obviously. Does this mean I have to ask for £ instead of $? Really what I'm looking for is someone to tell me how I should go about selling these safely and securely. I don't have a PayPal account yet but my sister does so I can use hers and then transfer it into my account. I'm just lost to know what to do though. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",0

Now I know, I know, he absolutely is authoritarian. I think the criticism that he and Trump have a lot in common is very apt. But for me, apart from the policy differences, the biggest difference between them is that Sanders seems like a genuinely good man, not in that he's perfect, but at his core he at least seems to do what he thinks is correct. Even if you disagree with some of his stances I think that's admirable.

Trump is not. He's an ass, a liar, a racist, a sexist, and a very likely sociopath. He is an unkind and unjust man and the idea that he has a real shot at the presidency makes my skin crawl. If all I disagreed with him on was policy that would be one thing, but the man is repulsive in every possible way.

THAT is the distinction to me. I'm still going to vote libertarian in the other elections, and if he loses the DNC nomination (and he likely will if we're honest) then I'm not going to conciliation prize with the devils sloppy seconds. But I know that voting 3rd party is effectively ""throwing my vote away"", and that's ok. I do it anyway so I can be a statistic. But I cannot and will not be forced into choosing between two evils. I cannot and will not stand by and watch American Hitler get elected without doing everything I can reasonably do to say no.

Although, I do kind of consider merc rarity like a bonus. It's not something I count on and I feel lucky just getting a HS, ruby or lives merc especially an epic+.

That said, mercenaries are something that you are ALWAYS getting some benefit from, just sometimes you get more benefit than other times, and that amount of benefit can decline (unlike any other benefit in the game), which is where my frustration lies.

Mercenaries constantly giving benefits feels more like a source of income, to use your analogy, like a ""paycheck"". To think of it like a ""bonus"" would mean thinking I get like 5 bonuses every 4 hours or so (assuming average quest length is 4 hours). My preconceived notion about ""bonuses"" is that they are a LOT more rare than that.

In his courses, he explicitly stated that the measure of your progress on the path is equanimity, and that if one does not grow compassionate as a result of practice then something is being done improperly. It is these statements that came to mind when I tried to reconcile what I saw in the video with what I think buddhists believe. 
 It'd be interesting to read a critical perspective, not many of those around. Though for my part, I'll admit that what you describe--an approach that does not weigh compassion heavily--is actually the most philosophically comfortable for me.

"25400","None of these are fixes, it's just ranting, because you're not fixing the core problem of the game, that being that None of the classes feel different at all.
IMO They should go 1 of 2 ways. 
If they want to keep with the jack-of-all trades vibe, the best thing they could do is give all 3 classes access to All equipment, and then give each of the classes built-in perks that make them better or more useful while using said equipment, also removing a perk slot or 2 in the process. That way if you want to be an infiltrator with an LMG or a Sniper, you can be, If you want to be an enforcer with stealth camo, you can be. But unless your an Enforcer that LMG's gonna be mighty inaccurate with a fuck ton of recoil. Unless you're a scout marking people is pretty difficult, and snipers are a bitch to use. You're not an infiltrator? Well good luck fultoning someone, and your stealth camo is pretty easy to see.
That means that they keep their ""everyone can do what they want"" vibe and still make your class choice matter.
My personal favourite is option 2, basically locking other classes out of certain things while increasing specialty to the max. If I'm a scout I'd much rather have built-in things like the intel 3 ability to mark anyone in my view finder, and the ability to spot through my Sniper, but I would prefer having a choice if I want to specialize in marking by making it faster or specialize in sniping by making it easier, or make it easier to spot people with NVG to see people. Just don't let me run around with an AR / Fulton people etc. Same goes for an enforcer, I want to be a huge brute with a massive machine-gun, why can I fulton people/mark people.
In doing this it makes each class useful and unique, while still allowing people to specialize in-to what they want to do.
But they'll never change the game this drastically, I one day hope modding comes out so I can do it myself but I still doubt that'd happen....",0

As for Beukeboom? It's a romantic thing to be sure for some fans to want him and he seemed to be a little successful as a development coach but what's more important is the role that AV wants from his Assistants. What he thinks he needs from them. Sounds like at least on paper the NYR are planning to redo components on the fly. What that looks like remains to be seen. But I do think that a coach needs to lose his team before he gets fired. See McLellan and one year later replaced by DeBoer and a facelift.

The good news is that you really don't have to do too much of anything. I would say the most helpful thing I learned while figuring out solids and BLW is to trust your child and relax. Slowly increase the number of proper meal times as your child ages and shows interest, while continuing to nurse as normal. After one I make sure my kids are sitting for each ""meal"" of the day and start introducing snacks and healthy food options as if they were getting all calories/nutrition from food, but not expecting the child to do so. Just continue nursing on demand and offering food. You'll find children naturally transition to more food as they age. It's amazing how little we really need to ""do"" as parents. Only worry about intake if there are other health problems or developmental concerns.

The Melo saga makes him come off as a terrible executive. Trying to force your star player to want to leave the team through other ways such as dogging him out in press conferences, interviews and through his writer friend. It's one thing to do all of that, but it's another to have to do all of that because you gave him the NTC to begin with. You would get scraps for him anyway. If he was't going to come to the Knicks without the NTC, he should have just let him walk. Phil wanted to rebuild anyway. There's been talks that Dolan wanted Phil to re-sign Melo so he did, I don't know if it's true or not but there's been several new york media guys who've mentioned it now.
There's been rumors that he was generally unavailable at the deadline for other GMs to contact him to begin with. Jerian+Lopez for Rose/Justin is what it is, that wasn't good or bad, especially since the Knicks had a big man logjam as it is. Plus rose walks and that's a good thing. By the way, Holiday is a stud.
What makes Knicks fans what Phil gone is not what's going on with Melo, it's his infatuation with the triangle and his remarkes in the closing press conference that he was going to actively become more invovled with coaching the triangle. That's not how a president of basketball operations runs a fucking team if he's not the coach and it screams to NBA players, fans, staff, media, etc. as a clown show and I can bet you that Hornecek will not last under that guise and so that will be the 3rd coach that's fired under Phil in not even a complete 5 seasons.",0

If you have the time and money though, along with a brisk walk and a change in diet, I would recommend strength training three times a week: push on day one (shoulders, chest, triceps), pull on day three (back and biceps), legs on day five. Take the weekend off, do abs any day you'd like (they tend to heal faster), and make sure that at least one day a week is a total rest day: no work related stress or strenuous exercise. But diet and sleep are very important. Also, water. Drink it, a lot. This is the routine I started with when I was obese and it worked great. Building muscle is something that a lot of large people (especially women) overlook when they decide to diet and exercise. More muscle mass creates work for your body to do which equals more calories burned.

I definitely think that people like you or me can definitely get there but it will take longer.  Keep in mind that Masters is top 4% and every other league is around 20%-25%. I learned that there are people who can get from Diamond to Masters in just a few month but that is not the majority...I think that since Masters is more exclusive you hear those stories more since there are fewer players of that league. Getting to Masters is all about the details and making those details natural thought and actions for you.

"26541","Let me help you. First, in your finding is undoubtedly a great story line. What we have to dig into, is how much of it is proof that the person who did it was really a murderer. Understand that I am NOT for innocence or guilt, I just recognize a police railroad when I see one.


&gt;&gt;His purchase of handcuffs and ""shackles""

They sound better as a weapon when you say LEG IRONS. They have NO bearing on innocence or guilt simply because there is NOTHING but a story line that connects TH to SA. NOTHING. Can you say a man is indeed guilty just because you found that he bought fuzzy pink shackles.... perhaps from a company who has made 3 million pairs in the last year, quite simply because capitalism obviously dictates how many people out there must buy them and get a kick out of them ? Sorry, a normal person can't or at least shouldn't.

&gt;&gt;the actions of a good level headed man is not to run someone off the road at gunpoint, no matter the circumstances.

He has never been a ""good and level headed man"". He went to a school SPECIFICALLY for what was referred to as ""retarded"" people. THAT is what it was called at that time, so do not blame me. I assure you he had been ridiculed all his life. I'd understand perhaps if he NEVER reacted like a ""good and level headed man"" based on his surrounding family or circumstances. While that event seems to be pretty well documented, it is CLEAR that he had a relative that routinely bullied him, and happened to be a friend of Police Dept. employees. It is certainly not a stretch to understand that there would have already been friction between Avery family members and the Police dept because of this. Given that the relative admitted to LYING about what Steve was supposedly doing, it is very possible that someone in his capacity dealt with this BULLY the only way he knew how. So, without knowing more and more about everything from Steves actual mental condition, to the level of bullying he received from this person, can you use this to absolutely know he killed Teresa ? I can't. And, I'm sorry, we all love fuzzy cats, but not everyone who did something bad to a cat has turned to killing people. There is no automatic anything there.... none. I obviously does not help him regards the story line... I get that.


&gt;&gt;being surrounded by hardened criminals

Can't argue that, but, first, WHO Put him there ? There are PLENTY of things about that case to show the Police railroad service in action... PLENTY. Secondly, has every man released from prison become a killer..... no, so that doesn't have any bearing. Do threatening letters to a wife who is leaving you thru the fault of the state indicate that you are a killer ? not to me. Sorry. If you want INTENSE PRESSURE, I bet that was incredibly difficult to take and I bet there are PLENTY of men who have written or said things when it was happening to them that are not killers. It does add to the story line. I get that. But again, I'm not mushy with this stuff. I'm a realist, and really ? This does not bear any evidence that he killed Teresa.

&gt;&gt;Teresa's fear of Steven

Wow. To me, this one is almost an emmy award winner. NOTHING really indicates that she FEARED going there other than Kratz's insane, known to be untrue pre-trial and post-trial rhetoric. The ONLY think ""creepy"" about this part of the story is that it seems to be a FANTASY being lived out by the kind of guy who would SEXT young girls. This is so overblown.... ""they laughed"" and she said ""ew"". THAT is all you have. Even her phone messages left PRIOR to her coming there were sweet and innocent and without fear.... ""call me back"" ! She said...... but they want you to think Steve was ""Stalking"" her. There is ZERO proof of stalking. But it is good for a story line. MEDIA loves this kind of stuff.


&gt;&gt;Steven Avery specifically called and ask for Theresa to come that day (under a false name).

I order crap from various companies. I ALWAYS ask for the person I dealt with in the past because they know me, they know already what I probably want, and they have done it for me before. This is not creepy. It certainly does not mean a man is a murderer, especially the *67... Heck, I have received phone calls from the POLICE that have BLOCKED THEIR CALL to me ! Does that instantly mean they are a killer ? The false name falls dead flat too. If he was stalking her and he did not want her to know what she was getting into, WHY LURE HER THERE to start with ? So many people come and go from that PUBLIC BUSINESS that you want me to believe he was so smart he could clean up every last stitch of blood and DNA from ""shooting her in the garage"" but too stupid to lure her elsewhere or even deep into the salvage yard right away rather than in his front yard. It does NOT make him guilty. But, does fit the story line of a sex addicted drug freaks fantasies quite well (IMHO). (I'll puke if I see Kratz talk about ""sweaty man"" one more time).


&gt;&gt;Avery is also accused of sexual assault of a family member.

Allegedly.... and once again, thank the very same police force for not getting to the BOTTOM of that issue. It never progressed passed ""alleged"" according to available documentation. Sad for that girl if true, but again, if you want fault, it drops right back to the police for not getting it documented. Perhaps something will jar Colburns memory now, 12 years later, and he will file a report on it ? I am truly saddened that a young girl of 16 may have been ""raped"". The problem with ""rape"" today is that a willing 16 year old girl is not held accountable for HER actions, only the BOY is supposed to know all the rules, even a retarded boy. There is MUCH to the actual reports on the issue that you just have to say, ""did the cops fail this girl more than anyone"" ? We can't tell. And ""rape"", be it alleged, or accused found guilty, sentenced, and exonerated STILL does not prove you murdered Teresa.

On a side note, THERE IS NO THING AS SWEAT DNA. Sounds good, but there isn't. Just another thing from the professional liars association. There is DNA that can be transferred from sweat, and that DNA can be obtained from practically anything a person touches or has touched. Heck, you could put your girlfriends ""Sweat DNA"" on something just by rubbing her socks on it. Cops had PLENTY of old socks (not to mention they admit they don't change gloves when jumping from one specimen collection to another) 

Well, it's been fun going over this again and I do agree, it is all sad. It's messed up. I'm neither in the guilty or not-guilty camp. No one should be publicly. We do not know. MOSTLY I am sad because at minimum, police in this whole fiasco tend to always fail to do their jobs CORRECTLY, and as such, Truth is never really found... justice never served. Only thing served is the higher up's egos. Powerful men they are. We all need to watch our back so we don't get ""Kratz'd"".",0

"286","Great question. Money and inflation are closely related. 
Inflation is basically the general increase in prices &amp; fall in the purchasing value of money. In the history of money, there has been a tendency for the issuer (typically the government) to make more money. The thinking is that by issuing more money, it may make people feel wealthier, and therefore want to spend more money, which should lift prices. For example, in Ancient Rome, silver coins were used as currency, but officials debased this money by issuing more coins that had lower amounts of metal. In other words, they were issuing more money, but less valuable money. Since paper money was invented, arguably in the Tang Dynasty in China, issuers have historically issued more money, trying to invoke inflation. In my book, I go through the history of paper money from Tang Dynasty, The rise and fall of the Yuan Dynasty in China, Eighteenth Century France, Colonial money (in one chapter). All too often, governments pursue a policy of inflation, print too much money, and then there's a financial crisis. Borrowers like inflation because when the time comes to repay the loan, they will pay in money that's less valuable. So governments that borrow a lot (think US, Japan) actively pursue a policy of inflation -- and they can do this by trying to control the amount of money in the economy. ",0

If you need to be told what you're role-playing as then you're doing it wrong, are you following a script, or are you building up your own mental image of how your character acts and following through with it, and their reactions to what happens in the world.
And besides, what if those options don't cover what I'm role-playing, what if I've got a 5th option?",0

Consider another similar example:
&gt;I was in spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, Saying, What you see **write in a scroll** and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. (Rev. 1:10-11)

&gt;And if anyone takes away from the words of **the scroll of this prophecy**, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll. (Rev. 22:19)

You may find some, but I think you would be hard-pressed to find any student of the Bible argue that it's okay to add words, passages, or to remove words and passages from the Bible.  Some might even cite Rev. 22:19 as an example of why we should not add or remove words from the Bible.  However, John was only warning not to add or remove anything from ""...the scroll **of this** prophesy.""   Are we therefore free to add/remove anything from the other 65 books of the Bible?",0

"39505","Bailing out industries in the past has been politically advantageous.  One can argue that by refunding them on taxes paid you are keeping an industry in Canada and keeping the jobs of all those high paid party donors.  The fallout of a total industry collapse is not something that any leader can risk.
In the 00s the Liberals opted to not bail out the Ontario manufacturing sector.  They were permitted to fail.  The result was a collapse of jobs and industry in Ontario.  It also lead to a collapse of support in Ontario.  Between 2000 (when the crash began) to 2004 the Liberals lost 25 seats.  They lost another 25 seats in the next election.
When the automotive industry collapsed in 2008 Harper bailed them out.  He didn't want to make the same mistakes as the Liberals of past.  He was given a boon of support in Ontario, a majority government and most importantly, strong political capital.  In the US Obama forced the car companies to make cars people would buy, sell their private jets, and most importantly, be profitable.
Bombardier is a difficult situation.  You want to bail them out to protect those jobs and gain support in Quebec, but the people who run the company are unwilling to change to make the company profitable.  I think people were against bailing out the automotive industry as long as the CEOs had those private jets and overpaid salaries.  Bombardier needs to get someone on board who is willing to work for performance bonuses.  They need to stop shelfing Canadian jobs after taking our money.
The only good news about Bombardier is that they're planning to get out of the train business.",0

In spirit prison people from paradise share the gospel with you, and if you repent of your past sins, and accept the proxy baptism done in the temple you can move to paradise. However spirits in spirit prison are influenced by both good and evil. This is because there ""has to be opposition in all things"". Another interesting point is that spirits take with them, after death, their acceptance or hostility towards God/his gospel. In other words you are still you after your death. If an atheist dies and is taught in the spirit world he still has his same dislike (for lack of a better word) for the idea of God, he still has his free will.

It's pretty easy to understand that a frail, elderly person in a deserted car park (i.e. unable to defend himself and no one else around to help) might be a bit scared if a stranger wearing a full face helmet and doing motorbike stunts suddenly approached them and told him to stop driving because something was wrong with his car. It's exactly the kind of tactic someone could use to get him out of his car to rob him, or steal the car, and when you're that age and quite vulnerable you're more scared of it.
Also, I've been cycling for years and you do from time to time see that people have something wrong with their car, a flat tyre, a dodgy looking wheel, a missing petrol cap etc. It's quite easy to catch up with them in traffic and tell them, but you have to bear in mind that often their initial reaction is fear and/or hostility that some stranger is trying to talk to them. And that's just as someone on a bicycle without any safety gear covering up my face! It should have been obvious to the rider that he needed to communicate better in order to get the driver to take him seriously. You can't just go straight into shouting incoherently without even taking off your helmet, meaning you have a muffled voice.

Both had rabid supporters who treated him like a cult figure who could solve everything, despite having an agenda that couldn't begin to get through Congress. Both were very uncharasmatic. Both got nearly nothing accomplished during their time in Congress. The similarities are numerous! 
""Undocumented"" is a new word that they've found gets the cause more sympathy than ""illegal"". They probably got it from a focus group session or something. The left really loves to play these games with words. 
You can support different sides of the same argument with [polls](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/20/mainstream-polls-show-americans-with-donald-trump-on-immigration/). Many other polls show Americans are with Trump on a number of things, part of it is how you ask the question!
Either way, do not underestimate Trump's ability to persuade and his ability to negotiate. He is a master at this stuff. If you educate the people on the cost in crime, in tax money, in jobs, on our healthcare system, in its effect on our culture, etc then even more people will side against illegal immigration than in favor of cracking down on it.

While objectivity in the news will always be limited by the necessarily subjective, perspective-based nature of news reporting, I suspect we are nearing an extreme in terms of deliberate disinformation.

The modDemix makes it easy to visually map the change because it has +/- LEDs. So you can see when the signal starts to veer into RM territory as the - LEDs start to fade in. You can take it all the way through to 0 - -10v modulation, but that's effectively back to unipolar AM.

I don't think we have anything to worry about. I believe we're in really, really good hands, and if you dive into the theology enough that is clear.  The gospels are called the Good News, because it's good news!  God exists, He loves us all, and He's solved the problem of human wickedness and given us the means to know Him!

You could take every single pro athlete in America and make them train soccer for a year and not a single one who doesn't have a soccer background would even make the US National team, let alone be the best in the world. Size and strength are NOWHERE near as important in Soccer as Basketball or American football. 
Usain Bolt has played a lot of soccer in his life and is a fan of the sport. He is pretty much as good of an athlete as it goes and yet looks like an amateur when he plays. Because that's what he is.
The level of competition worldwide in soccer is on a completely different level to any of the top three American sports. There are almost as many registered footballers as there are people in the US (and a few billion unregistered). If you haven't played it since you were a kid, you simply can't become that good. 
That said, if you had a huge pool of super athletes you might be able to turn a few of them into decent pro's as a no-nonsense ultra physical defensive players if you gave them enough time, but more than a year for sure.

New York is a very, very important state but given the significant and despicable opposition that all of you mention in great detail in your notes, for me, this only serves to fortify my conviction to support the Sanders campaign even more.  The passion only grows every single day, independent of any specific poll or primary result.  I see it as a 50 state race.  NY, PA, and all other states that are to come are as important as any other.
On a personal level, I favor the notion that Sanders wants to be and is running for President not because it is some birthright, or something promised long ago, ;), or a natural course of events, or because some earth-bound secretive and monolithic authority said so, or because it was something purchased somehow back in '08.  
This Senator from Vermont wants to go to work for us.  He is not looking for a coronation.  Rather, Sanders wants to become our employee.  He seeks not to reign, he wants to serve.  How about that?  How refreshing is that?  I kinda favor that type of thinking.  The DNC has apparently lost sight of the fabulous passage that start with, We the People . . .

&gt; Progressive Except Palestine-PEP. A term many of us know and have used to describe someone who has a commitment to progressive causes-civil rights, human rights, movements for justice-except when it comes to Palestine and Israel.

&gt; Being Progressive except Palestine not only means supporting Israeli brutality-it really does mean that-but it also means supporting US imperialism.

&gt; To say Progressive except Palestine makes it seem as if crimes against Palestine and Palestinians are an aside, not central to what makes someone a progressive, ethical person-as if you can say you adhere to principles of justice except for this &amp;quot;One small&amp;quot; thing.

As soon as everyone in the neighbourhood understood that Crazy Dave was costing the HOA a bunch of money and we were bleeding them dry in legal fees that they told him to fuck off and elected a new board.
The point is that for however much you think it is or isn't, the HOA has to spend money defending it. And when the members realise that even if they're in the right, it's going to cost them money to support some narcissistic nutcase against a person who isn't even in the HOA, they will back off because they don't want to pay more in dues. 
Even my attorney said that it would be hard to prove harassment, so the point was to tie up the HOA and make them spend money. Since I traded professional services with him and he really disliked the players on the other side, we went after it vigorously. ",0

"37078","Crimes against police. Police officers already enjoy significant advantages, both legally and unofficially, in any conflict with regular citizens. Their jobs are also not nearly as dangerous as is sometimes suggested, despite tragic accidents and violent deaths that occasionally happen. And they are not in *increasing* danger; generally, the number and violence of crimes against police is not on the rise.
Want to get all upset about danger to public safety workers? Forest rangers. Their jobs are much more dangerous, both from accidents and from violence. All sorts of illegal shit happens in national parks, and solo (often no partner for miles) forest rangers tend to be the ones who find it. Drug runners plan their routes through national parks. Fugitives head into parks to hide out, and lots and lots of drunk assholes with guns go camping.
So if you want a cause, increasing respect and protection for forest rangers is a much greater need. However, talking about ""the thin brown line"" doesn't have a very good PR ring to it, so you'll have to come up with a different rallying slogan.",0

Today, that label is too often applied to politics that are essentially reactionary and functionally selfish -- and that latter aspect explains a lot about cases where ""good kids"" can't see where they went wrong.~~ 

EDIT: Obviously, I had a brain fart here and misread the word ""conservation"". But the actual word used is even more damning. Of all people, these students should not have had to be told how to behave on public lands.

It's a shame that their education has been so narrow that they don't realize there has been a series of incidents in recent years of tourons defacing public lands in the west, and so don't know that they *will* be hit with the hardest possible punishment to make the point.

"17458","I can't give specifics about the best stats a rare 9 can have at the same time because I didn't make the game and don't know if I actually have ""the best"" rare 9 relic possible, but I can list my usable rare 9 relics and then give you my guess as to how it works.

I have a lance with 782 raw, 420 water, one slot, and 40 purple sharpness with sharpness+1. 

I have another with the same raw/sharpness but it has two slots and no element (I keep it to use as a spot-filler in how I organize my weapons, and it ended up being useful for this theory, ha).

One with 690 raw, 450 ice, two slots, and 40 purple sharpness with sharpness+1.

One with 713 raw, 450 dragon, two slots, and 20 purple sharpness with sharpness+1.

A gunlance with 782 raw, 500 ice, one slot, and 20 purple with sharpness+1.

It seems that the better stats are in one place the worse they are in another. If I give them point values (3 for best, 2 for ""decent"", and 1 for ""shitty"") it looks like a rare 9 relic can't go above 9 points. Coincidence?

Raw: 782 is 3 points, 713 is 2 points, and 690 is 1 point.

Element: 470-500 is 3 points, 420-450 is 2 points, and none is 1 point.

Sharpness: Natural purple and 40 with sharpness+1 are 3 points, 20 purple with sharpness+1 and 10 purple with sharpness+1 are two points, and everything else is 1 point.

Slots: ooo is 3 points, oo is 2 points, and o is one point.

....

The ice gunlance, for example, has amazing raw/element (782 and 500), decent sharpness (20 with sharpness+1), and an awful (one) number of slots. The points add up like this for those stats: 3+3+2+1=9

The two slot (2 points), max raw (3 points), 40 purple with sharpness+1 (3 points), but no element (1 point) lance also scores a 9 (2+3+3+1). 

Some score lower (8) and I know that rare 9 relics can score less than 8, too, but I'd guess that they can't go higher than 9 points using the system I just pulled out of my ass. Does anyone have one that scores higher than 9?",0

I dont believe that the coaching staff is that dumb and in this case I believe what Saint said about peter stepping down because he couldn't deal with piglet overruling him.

"12224","Lol, that's bullshit. Success is a repeatable formula that anybody can do. People just refuse to try, research it, or even spend the time looking into it. They just assume they're going to fail. They're too busy making excuses about why they're going to fail that they don't even look into any of the countless opportunities available to them that take little to no startup capital. 
The funny thing is, you don't even have to improve your skill set. 
You could, for example, take $300 and hire a bunch of VAs to research trends in the app market for you and provide you with their findings, pick a couple of ideas, spend another $600 hiring conractors to develop the app for you, and then spend another $400 marketing it for a pretty common ROI of $20,000 over a three month period and then scale up your process. 
Hell, I know a guy who hires VAs to research niche Kindle book markets, hires somebody to write 10,000 words on those niches, and then puts them on the store and hires more VAs to market those books for him and he nets about $10,000 a month. 
Drop shipping is another great option, arguably one of the easiest things to get into. 
For example, in your spare time you could pay $200 for somebody to build out a Shopify store for you. 
Then, you could spend an afternoon looking up - let's say - manufacturers who make luxury chess sets (a niche product that isn't dependent upon brand and that appeals to upper-middle class with disposable income). 
Then, you just reach out to t hose manufacturers and get anywhere from 2% to 10% to agree for you to sell their products on your site. 
Then, you simply hike up the price about 20%, advertise on Google Shops for about $1,000 in your first month, and whenever you get an order you forward it to the manufacturer who ships it direct - you never have to handle or ship product. It's exactly what retail stores do, but without owning a building or housing the literal wholesale product and you simply charge retail prices. 
I mean... I could go on and on. It's not even a losing bet on most of these strategies. It's just a simple formula. I have plenty of friends who have two or three drop shipping stores and net around $15,00 to $20,000 a month in largely passive income (they just manage their VA team). 
It's absurd for you to think this is some kind of entrepreneurial undertaking with a 90% failure rate. 
I can pop off about another 15 strategies for making easy money online with barely any startup capital right now that involves no learning curve, a pretty much guaranteed success rate, and no particular skill set necessary. 
People just don't even want to try. They  just want to complain. They don't even fucking look into it. It's insane to me. Absolutely insane. 
When I travel I'm surrounded by Digital Nomads who are all doing this, and they just followed the same formulas as everybody else. 
Hell, I tried out Teespring.com a couple of months ago and netted $7,000 in one week and three hours of work off an EXPERIMENT. 
All I did was hire someone on Fiverr.com to make me a niche logo (targeting males over the age of 45 who were interested in fishing) and created a witty little design. 
I then created a Facebook ad campaign targeting those users, and sold about 250 shirts over an 8 day period. Teespring just gives you the money and ships the shirts. I spend about $1500 in advertising. 
Easy peezy.

Sort of like how Civ or Age of Empires does it, but with a few more UUs/UAs.

eg: Poland and Germany would both share a basic infantry, mortar and AT squad with the exact same performance characteristics. Germany would get the Panzer 1, 2, 3 with unique stats, Poland would get AT Rifle Cavalry, TKS and 7TP (I think?) with unique stats. Another example, Belgium might get Chasseur Ardennes as a unique elite infantry unit.

This would substantially reduce the amount of inter-faction variability -- thereby reducing learning curve and balancing challenges inherent in numerous small variations between factions -- without eliminating the fun variation inherent in interesting unit variation. 

A tldr of my design philosophy is that units should only vary from the baseline when there is a compelling reason for them to do so. Anything else creates balancing nightmare especially as number of factions increases.",0

"2215","I agree about Ockham's razor. I think its much more accurate to speak of models (an ensemble of interrelated beliefs) rather than beliefs in isolation. But beliefs in isolation are still useful to speak of. And so what are the consequences of an instrumental notion of belief, and the fact that beliefs are interrelated have on justification for a belief?
Some points that need to be reconciled:
(1) It seems appropriate that a belief that has no consequences for our world-model should be decided based on a preponderance of evidence (e.g. what day of the week it is) 
(2) It seems inappropriate that a belief that has severe consequences for our world-model should be decided on a preponderance of evidence (Gods, simulations, orbiting teacups).
(3) It seems meaningless to claim a belief in something while disavowing any consequences of this belief (e.g. I believe in God but I'm not going to change my behavior because I might be wrong).
(4) It is preferable that our rationally decided behavior should move continuously towards the ideal rational behavior, no matter what the order evidence is received.
How are these points to be reconciled? One such criteria might be that we forgo consideration of beliefs in isolation, and instead judge a model in its entirety. And so belief in God is judged by the model of the world that results in accepting the proposition vs the model with its opposite. This analysis would inherently require a significantly greater amount of evidence to ascend to belief in God precisely because of the consequences it has for one's world-model. In cases where there are no model-breaking consequences (day of the week type things), then this analysis reduces to simply a preponderance of evidence.

If you don't by soda, chips, candy, sugary cereal and a shit load of frozen dinners, pizzas, etc. and instead by chicken, ground beef, eggs, fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc. you end up spending about the same if not less. I used to see it all the time.  These families will run through 2 12pks of soda, 2 boxes of cereal, 2 bags of chips, tons of candy and more frozen food than you can imagine because the food is not filling at all and does nothing for your body so you stay hungry.  Also, drink water and save a lot on not buying soda and put that towards better food.  It is amazing how much EBT some people received and how poorly they spent it.  I would see kids not even 2 years old eating cheetos and drinking soda.  They don't stand a chance.

At that time I also used Asahi Net mobile router, which was like 40 - 50 dollars a month for all you can use internet. Downside is you have to carry around another device.

First let's separate populated worlds into two categories: space flight capable and primitive.  Primitive worlds could have small clusters of huts or buildings and could still be made to appear realistic enough.  However, creating realistic procedurally generated Space flight capable worlds could prove difficult or even impossible.       
      
The elevator idea gives us a way to *fix* this.  Give players access to a finite area on the surface to explore, ie, the hub or station the elevator is grounded to.  This would be the only method to get to the surface of these planets (or via a shuttle as already mentioned).  Try to enter the atmosphere with your ship and get blown to bits by orbital weapons platforms.      
       
You could still procedurally generate the surrounding landscape, visible through windows, but this would allow you to relax on the level of detail and you wouldn't have to worry about people getting close to messed up procedurally generated city structures or sentient creatures.

What alot of people do is that they will buy a Laptop Shell (Only has Motherboard and CPU)  Usually for the style of the case/power of the processor ect.  They can then add RAM and HDD/SDD maybe both, might as well partition each drive so it looks like you have 8 of them.

Also a lot of the flashbacks didn't make sense where they were. You'd get one in the middle of the modern day story where it was only tangentially related to the scene it was stuck in the middle of. Arrow does that a lot, and it drives me nuts. Superhero shows/movies are so terrified of showing origin stories now, and understandably so, since there's been pushback against them for awhile, but I feel we're moving too far the other way where we're left wondering how superfreak got his freak on, and then when it's chucked out to us mid-season it feels anti-climatic.

"35411","I think it's a pretty way to say ""Fin"" as well as being a commentary on history vs. the past. The whole show is narrated like a historical documentary, we get the narrator's moral judgements and analyses throughout the show, which is exactly what history is. We don't get to see everything that a more personal story would show. While facts don't change, history aka people's view of the past definitely does. Now that the war is decidedly over people will be able to view what happened and decide what things mean to them. We can't necessarily understand the true impact of something while it happens, or be unbiased enough to understand why it happened. Like Lebelo didn't really see where the FPA was going and made some bad choices due to that. There is new knowledge out there for people to reflect on now that people can take a step back.  Now that the legend has ended (the war) the story of Reinhardt or Yang is no longer theirs but instead humanity's to make of as it will. 

I think it's very fitting with how the average fan feels after finishing the show. You feel like you  just watched the defining moments of your era and now it's all gone and you are only left to reflect. A big theme of the show is people not understanding history and fucking up because of that, the final words to me are the period at the end of the sentence that is the show and that sentence is, ""Learn from history, because while it doesn't repeat, it certainly rhymes.""

"16462","[Sugar is addictive.](http://media2.policymic.com/dbb0f9fcd9e7f8ae0bdff287e5cbbc04.jpg)

I'm just gonna C&amp;P my response from an AskReddit thread yesterday.

Sometime obesity researcher here. I did my master's thesis on the effects of diet on obesity and food preferences.

A lot of obesity research uses the ""DIO"" (diet induced obesity) model. In this model, some rats are fed a high-fat diet and become obese, while others are fed normal rat chow. The two groups can then be compared to draw inferences about causation (instead just correlation), because there is a control group. 

Among other things, diet induced obesity produces reduced responsiveness to low levels of palatable substances (i.e. sweet and fatty foods). This is accompanied by normal or elevated responsiveness to high levels of palatable substances, meaning that the subjects are more likely to ignore moderately calorie dense stuff in favor of the REALLY calorie dense stuff. The same has been found in humans (although obviously in human research you've got ""correlation doesn't imply causation""). 

The upshot is that obesity almost certainly reflects dysregulation of food intake, due at least in part to exposure to extremely palatable foods. What does that mean for ""calories in - calories out?"" It means that while weight gain / loss is of course determined by intake - expenditure, there's no avoiding the fact that there's an Olympus Mons sized mountain of evidence that consuming highly palatable food (i.e. junk food) affects an individual's subsequent ability to effectively regulate their own caloric intake. Artificial sweeteners are probably bad for your ability to regulate, also.


So... If you want to lose weight our avoid gaining weight, stay away from junk food, especially soda. It won't make you any fatter than a calorically equivalent amount of other foods, but it WILL screw with your ability to regulate your own dietary intake in the future.

Sugar is addictive.  

[edit - sources]

[causal effect of diet induced obesity on sweetness / fat preference](http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/301/5/R1267)  (This article also notes some interesting similarities between rats selectively bred to be obesity-prone and rats that were not bred for obesity, but were made obese by their diet, indicating that genetic predispositions to obesity and the effect of diet on obesity may be synergistic.)

"11894","Touching on the distinction between ""increase"" and the ""right of increase,"" do you think that such capitalistic practices are fully possible and acceptable as ways in which the anarchic world may operate, given that the supposed ""right"" to these increases would be abolished? If so, doesn't this mitigate a lot of the differences between what a typical ancap's desired system's *actual* manifestation would be, and the philosophy you support? I think most ancaps would, if the word weren't ""poisoned"" by the Left, expect that what Proudhon, his followers, and today's subscribers of his economics thought to be the right of increase, would vanish, leaving behind only instances of increase that do not create a further ""right"" to more increase. This is to say, ancaps have nothing wrong with increase, but in their emphasis, it falsely appears that they support more than simple increase; they appear to support a right to it. I think the State's interference in the market is a large factor in the creation of the monopolies that allow for a right of increase, but I find this opinion to be extremely unpopular, in due part to its lack of comprehension by ancaps.
Obviously you've developed your own beliefs more than the typical ancap has, but disregarding this, how different do you think your preferred political economy would be from an anarcho-capitalists? ",0

It is calculated to have cost fewer lives and dollars to use these weapons. If NK bombed civilians in SK, that would be an act of total war. The USA has said all options are on the table. Look, I really don't know how fast the USA and SK could sweep up the NK army after that attack. But perhaps the USA has calculated the cost of nuking a country such as North Korea. If NK were to commit to total war while pursuing nukes... and they are nuked... they will have no choice but surrender or get nuked again... and maybe they will commit to a new strategy of non-proliferation. Or maybe it will strengthen their desire for retaliation. And maybe it will piss off China and Russia but what are they going to do about it? Nuke us? Not likely. But it may also be seen as a counter-incentive for countries like Iran to keep building a bomb. Or the opposite. I dont know ;/",0

"35003","I was in the Gary camp after Rand dropped out, I was turned off when by his globalist statements about signing TPP and that illegal immigration isnt an issue. Trump certainly has rough spots around his economic policy and I would like a balanced budget but I also concede that temporary deficits in return for higher growth will be better in the long run.

As for foreign policy I think your a little off with Trump, I don't find him to be an isolationist, he wants to stop nation building and work with NATO and Russia to completely obliterate ISIS and then look inward to fix our problems. We don't need to be spending billions protecting other nations when we can have those troops on our border preventing illegal immigration for half the cost, with the rest of the money going to R&amp;D. I'm relieved that he wants to work with Russia, we've worked with them in the past. Conflict with the Russians is net loss for both of us. 

My ideal election scenario is Trump wins the presidency and Johnson gets over 5% of the national vote. The libertarians take their federal funding and ballot access and win a few democratic/RINO congressional districts and possibly a senate seat in 2018 so they can control swing votes and bring congress back to the center.

That would put the number of married-to-extant Amerindians by the first generation at what, maybe 1/3 of that at most, with perhaps 20 kids or so?

&gt;""When an enemy's attack hits, a portion of the HP gauge briefly turns orange, indicating the amount of damage inflicted.  Attack the enemy before the orange bar disappears to restore a given amount of HP.""

I don't want a ""Blood Flask"", which is a reframed term for Estus and not very well veiled at that.  I want a set amount of Blood Vials.  I'd take a reduction in Blood Vials; however, if Rallying attacks locked the potential health meter in some fashion instead of having the timer still run down as I strike an enemy.  

I think it's vital that Vials remain as they are in terms of their speed/effectiveness because the only time they're ""low risk"" is against mobs.  Bosses in this game can be fairly difficult depending on the encounter and the equipment set.  Healing should be useful in this regard and I'd sooner it be more available in that we just solve the issue of it running out.  

In fact, I think raising the Vial storage cap would be a lesser but acceptable solution.  Ideally, you'd receive a base number of blood vials.  The main thing is that the flavor of being a resourceful hunter is what Blood Vials do at the beginning of the game, I just feel that it wouldn't hurt the game for that to fall off as you reach a certain point past the beginning or even middle of the game.  But having to choose between grinding a boss' attacks and patterns and grinding health is not a decision a player should have to make, and it really hurts this game.",0

""Made redundant"" means your services are no longer required but says nothing about your skills or performance as an employee. ""Fired"" means you were so bad at your job or did something so bad while working there that the company will no longer tolerate you - and very likely they will hire someone to replace you.

[WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/iud-intrauterine-device?page=3#1) says:

&gt;Can my IUD fall out?
Your doctor will check your device during your regular office visits. Your cervix should hold the IUD in place, but in rare cases, it can fall all the way or part of the way out.

&gt;This is more likely if:


&gt;You don't have children.
You’re under 20 years old.
You had the IUD put in right after having a baby or after having a second-trimester abortion.
You have fibroids in your uterus.
Your uterus is an unusual size or shape.

Now, I didn't live on campus, so I avoided most of it just by being a commuter, but I still have a story about this:
All incoming freshmen had to attend a three-day (IIRC) orientation.  I had kind of a strange situation/case, as I had taken classes there as a dual-credit student in HS, and had amassed enough credit hours that *officially* I was coming in as a ""degree-seeking"" student as a sophomore, which allowed me to circumvent the requirement of living on campus for a semester, so I was relieved to think that I could get out of this also.  Nope, no such luck.  I played frustrating phone tag with the administration and vigorously pleaded my case every which way, to no avail.  They told me unequivocally and firmly that I would be required to attend this orientation.  ""But technically I'm a sophomore!"" I said.  ""But I'm not even going to live on campus!"" I pleaded.  They didn't care.
So I'm already in a sour mood going into this, and then I discover that it's mostly hours upon hours of alcohol education, for *multiple days in a row*.  Seriously, well over half the orientation was dedicated to alcohol.  They had cheesy, poorly-done scenario skits about sexual assault on alcohol that only served to severely muddle the issue, and they literally had presentations on what to do in the event of alcohol poisoning if someone started to turn various shades of different colors.  There was a brief talk about time management and campus resources, a quick safe-sex reminder that was totally heteronormative and as such didn't really apply to me anyway, and then alcohol this, booze that, drinking harm reduction the rest of the time.
I was *irked* to say the least.  Irate, even.  (I take prescription drugs on occasion now, but...) I really *was* a teetotaler then-- wasn't even prescribed psychiatric meds of any sort, and didn't touch psychoactive substances aside from caffeine at all.  Basically the whole orientation I was stupidly required to sit through was useless to me.  I realized shortly afterwards that this was probably all done for liability reasons--there had been *many* incidents of alcohol-related arrests, ridiculous shenanigans and a few poisoning deaths in recent years at the school, and I suppose they wanted to ensure that parents couldn't try to sue.
I'm all for harm reduction, but the whole thing inherently *assumed* that we would all be drinking at some point, and that we would all be doing so in the most irresponsible ways possible.  It probably even *encouraged* alcohol consumption as a result, it was over-the-top, and it shouldn't be required for students who don't even partake.",0

But yeah I agree. 
&gt;what seems to me to be a less cynical tone than Kimmel, less juvenile than Fallon, more political / serious than Conan.
This is exactly how I see him. All are out of touch IMO with pop-culture, Jimmy making fun of gamers and nerds and all of that, Conan plays dumb and admits he knows nothing about gaming/nerd culture/etc, and don't get me started on the faux nerd that is Fallon. 
But Colbert seems really in touch with the younger audience. Loving Star Wars, LOTR, GOT, all the pop culture stuff, knowing about tech and ""in"" companies and all that. 
I don't have a problem per-se with the others, they are just different flavors. But when I want mindless funny and fun conversations I tune into Graham Norton, or the wannabe (in a good way) Graham Norton; James Corden. If i want interesting and potentially a real discussion and to learn and have fun I will watch Colbert. Jimmy I like but sometimes he is too harsh/negative/pranky. Fallon I like the least just because he is...something. Hard to put your finger on. 
But yeah I think what Colbert is doing has its place and with time his audience will grow. As the Presidential race ends and a new President wins the political stuff with die down and the republican vs democrat thing will die down and more republicans will watch his show. ",0

But that is not a common thing. In some places bartenders prepare drinks strictly in the order that was made by orders. That happens in large bars usually because it's hard to remember everything when you distract yourself. So in this kind of places the best way to get your drink is to wait calmly. If I'm in the middle of something with bazillion of drinks in my mind and you're shouting or trying to tip beforehand - well, it's not about my anger or something like that, I'll make it slower only because you fucked with my memory and I lost the momentum.

For this to be true requires a serious mangling of the left-right spectrum as it is ordinarily defined. In loosest terms the Left is revolutionary and progressive, they want to change and transform existing institutions. The Right wishes to preserve them. 

What passes for the left-right spectrum in recent NZ politics is closer to a doctrinal dispute among revolutionary progressives about what kind of radical change is for the best. The left-wingers you refer to want redistribution of wealth for what they take as the collective social good. 

The pseudo-right of the National Party wants to enact transformation by eroding the existing social and cultural institutions in favor of a politically borderless and economically homogenous global order centered on the interests of elites, mainly in the US and the UK. This is a very recent development, since the 1980s and 90s, and it coincides with the predominance of neoconservative policies in Western nations, which assimilated a revision of classical economic liberalism (""neoliberalism""). This is ""right-wing"" only in name, and it undermines the division into right and left to begin with. 

What I referred to by Economy Lefties are the globalists who want to sell out our nation (every nation) in order to get a piece of the pie that most of us will never see.

And you definitely should add one unpopular token offered by platform providing useful service like TIES or Primas.

1. Same as you can't teach a fish to climb a tree, you can't force a dog to live underwater. Neither is a pussy for wanting to live in their original environment. I will let others to pursue the ideal of a ""strong woman"" if they wish.

2. YOU, Dysphoria, don't make sense. Maybe my 'self' is a guy, and there are no rules against being a feminine/flamboyant guy. And if someone thinks there are, they're simply projecting sexist bullshit onto others.

3. Disorder breeds disorder. I am a broken wooden post that can't hold the roof anymore. I need fixing. If I break, the roof will fall and I won't be supporting it. If I'm repaired, things will stay in place and the order is preserved. The only selfish thing here would be to push others away, give in to dysphoric thoughts, decide that everyone's against me while most likely they just don't understand why I'm breaking. That helps no one. Anyone can create disorder out of weakness, but it takes some strength to do otherwise. Fixing process may not be ideal or even long lasting, I may even decide to change things along the way, but it's a conscious attempt to create some order.

u trying to say cops arent trained enough for that. Than man had no weapon for christ sake and there were more than one cop. i saw so many videos of how cops in other states deal with mad people. Taking someone's life really isn't and shouldn't be an option for cops unless there is really the need to. Its just like an ordinary man putting on the uniform, grabs 1 or 2 weapons/tools and goes out there to protect citizens. Cops are and should be trained get that point please. they could have done pretty much better trust me. Its so sad we dont understand such cases because these victims are no relatives to us. Maybe we would be understanding then.",1
