201,  Hmm thats a tough one. I would hate it if I couldnt' bare my own child. that would be really hard. and i would probably pray my guts out before going the other route but if its enivetable then I guess I would adopt. Surrogate mothers are too hard to trust not them wanting the child in the end..that would be really hard.

203,  Hmm..depends on if my toes are cutesied up and the outfit ;] but usually sneakers

207,  hmmm i havent been scared in a while
208,  Hmmm idk if i completely understand the question..
209,  hmmm im not sure.
210,  hmmm probably buy a few things for me and one of my besties :D
211,  Hmmm...personal? root word.. lol umm probss... bubbly  nice  honest(sumtyms)
212,  Hmmm..the second one i guess. but id have to go cammando.
213,  Hmmmm
214,  Hola! :]

252,  I have a chocolate. r A blackberry would be nice to carry I suppose but its a waste of money. All phones do the same for what I need. textingg :] ha
253,  I have him. My Timmy :]r He's super in everyway possible. Sweet and sensitive enough to understand but hard and can stand his ground when it comes down to it. A little over protective but only enough to show that he truly cares. He brings flowers home for me being his girlfriend day! :] If I want anything he'd get it but knows I have everything I want. Compassionate and caring and loves everything that I do. He enjoys all the same foods as I do and is open to exploring new boundaries he's never expierenced. Ohh and He let's me be crazy about things that Im so passionate about  that most guys would laugh at and make fun of. Recycling  planting flowers and smiling at people just because I want to make their day! :] He's perfect for me. He understands me in every aspect a man could. Hes sweet enough to damper my attitude and sarcasm at times but bullheaded enough to not always give in to me. Lets me whine if I want attention and holds me more than I could ever want to be held. I love him. And for me  hes my perfet guy! <3r Ohh and he's a super sexxy stud :] of course.

491,  Okay Im super glad you asked me this question  only because its a common misconception about hiccups. Your not supposed to hold your breath. The reason you have hiccups in the first place  is lack of oxygen. So the usual hold your breath till your face turns blue and still keep holding it  isn't what makes them go away. Its the deep breath you take after holding your breath :]r r So to relieve my hiccups  I hold my breath ;) haha only to take a bigger breath afterward.
492,  okay.
493,  okayy
494,  okayyy

558,  telling someone that you dont love them back. ive had to do it and it is so tough to say.
559,  Thank you <3
560,  Thanks. It was in Panama with 7 other chicks. Funn times.
561,  thanks... Who is yew???
562,  Thankss(:
563,  thanksssssss :)
564,  thats a good question. r I don't understand that either. because this world is all backwards and people say all kinds of things that they dont mean but it doesnt mean they will do what they say. beauty of being a human. say what comes out of your mouth but your body does what your mind thinks  not what your mouth says.
565,  Thats a really hard question because ive gotten emails saying that highjackers are using baby car seats on the side of roads to get women to stop and see if theres a child in them and then kill them and take their car! I would kind of think the same thing. I would prolly pull over if Timothy was with me  definantly. But alone i'd have to pass and turn around..contemplating. He always tells me not to stop. cause i used to all the time
566,  Thats for Taelin to know .
567,  Thats great . i hope things work out fine.. (:
568,  thats nice to no lol=]
569,  the bs.
570,  The earth. People's feelings. the way others react to people having a bad day. Kids :] Learning new things all the time.

574,  the nicest thing someone has ever done for would probaly be  when sam my sister just told me for no reason that i was a really good person and stuff
575,  The upkeep of downtown. its beautiful in what you can find in an innercity but the horrible the way it gets soooo run down by the next year or so. its sad really.
576,  the vibe they give off
577,  There is no perfect lol but I suppose with a funny guy-polite  random and spontaneous  maybe a night out at a 70's club and dress up go to dinner before. haha that'd be fun!! :)
578,  They've been good :)
579,  They don't feel. Theyre are wayy to many people in this world that don't truly care if they hurt anothers feelings. And its like it makes them feel better about themself. But in reality  they're only insecure about something they have to deal with  whether it be personally or physically or emotionally..just because your not happy with yourself  doesn't mean you should try to make others feel worse about themselves. But that is just my opinion and what do I know. Friendliness only gets a slap in the face more often than not. :] pass it on haha
580,  they made me shit ;0
581,  they matter but they aren't the decision.
582,  they used to be and i like them to be that way but any more with timothy in my life they arent
583,  theyre either trying to get through a bunch of questions or thats all they had to say on the topic of the question
584,  this would take forever hahah!! but  the perfect guy as short as i could make it would be  r himself  he wouldnt try to impress every one and he would care about everyone and not be very mean. he would be some sort of musician. or artist. super funny and great personality. i dont really care about looks. though its great if the guy could be cute.
585,  tim.&amp; i dont think men are hot.
586,  Timmy. He held me down and tickled me

638,  well its real meaning is a female dog. :) ahhahar but I would define it as:r An inconsiderate person that doesn't care what people think nor if or how they hurt another persons feelings. Someone who is usually insecure of themselves and have to put other people down to make themselves feel better about ones self. hahaha

3202,Thanks for the ass-kicking ... getting sucked into Twitter. Needed that. And yes  reading is really tough at 90% MHR.

3222,that's good.....I reallllly need more RAM  but saving money is a bitch.
3223,that's happened to me twice in the past 4 months. Pain in the ass. Much.
3224,that's killer. Wish it was even cool here. But it's been damn near 80 most of the week. No where near festive temps.
3225,That's one thing I noticed when I first installed it too. Damn thing took over my preferences.
3226,That's really too bad.  But don't let one silly bitch spoil your vibes.  Keep catching the melonheads.  :)

3230,that's what you fucking get for that fucking video!
3231,"that's why I hate them. ""Oooops  why don't I go this way and destroy your whole story. Or maybe ill refuse to say anything."""
3232,"that  and ""I'm not gay"" aw I miss bonez.  I hope he's not in prison."
